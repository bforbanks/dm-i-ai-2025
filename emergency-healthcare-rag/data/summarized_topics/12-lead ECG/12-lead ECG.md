# 12-lead ECG

**Definition/Overview**
- The de Winter ECG pattern is an electrocardiographic finding indicative of acute left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery occlusion, characterized by upsloping ST-segment depression at the J point in leads V1-V6 with tall, peaked T waves.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Chest pain
- Shortness of breath
- Diaphoresis
- Discomfort
- Symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (ACS)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- ST-segment depression of 1-3 mm at the J point in leads V1-V6
- Tall, peaked T waves in the same leads
- Often accompanied by 1-2 mm ST-segment elevation in lead aVR
- Possible poor R wave progression in precordial leads
- Normal or slightly widened QRS complexes

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Hyperkalemia
- Tachycardia
- Other causes of ST-segment depression

**Treatment Options**
- Immediate cardiology consultation
- Early referral for cardiac catheterization
- Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as per STEMI guidelines
- Administration of aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitor, and anticoagulation as recommended

**Critical Considerations**
- High suspicion for LAD occlusion in patients with ACS risk factors or clinical features
- Early recognition and treatment are crucial for improving outcomes
- Cardiac biomarkers (hs-cTn) should be assessed but should not delay reperfusion strategy

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Occurs in 2-3.4% of patients with anterior myocardial infarction
- Associated with occlusion of the coronary arteries, typically due to atherosclerotic disease
- Proposed mechanisms include subendocardial ischemia and collateral circulation influences

**Prognosis**
- Early recognition and treatment are critical due to the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with large anterior MI

**Deterrence and Patient Education**
- Patients should be educated on ACS symptoms and the importance of seeking urgent medical evaluation to reduce patient delays and total ischemic time.
