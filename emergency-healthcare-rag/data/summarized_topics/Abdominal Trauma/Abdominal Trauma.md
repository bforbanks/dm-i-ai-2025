# Abdominal Trauma

**Definition/Overview**
- Abdominal trauma encompasses injuries to the abdominal region from both blunt force and penetrating mechanisms, such as gunshot wounds, with varying degrees of organ damage and hemorrhage.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Pain
- Hemodynamic instability
- Peritonitis (rigidity, guarding, rebound tenderness)
- Absent bowel sounds
- Ecchymosis
- Abdominal distention
- Bleeding per rectum

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- **Penetrating trauma (gunshot wounds):**
  - Hemodynamic instability and peritonitis indicate immediate surgical intervention.
  - FAST/EFAST ultrasound to assess for hemoperitoneum.
  - CT scan for stable patients without peritonitis to evaluate organ damage.
- **Blunt trauma:**
  - EFAST ultrasound or diagnostic peritoneal lavage for unstable patients.
  - CT scan for hemodynamically stable patients to assess solid organ injury.

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Penetrating vs. non-penetrating injury
- Gunshot wound, stab wound, or other penetrating mechanisms
- Domestic violence, hemorrhagic stroke, hypovolemic shock, genitourinary trauma, pregnancy trauma

**Treatment Options**
- **Penetrating trauma (gunshot wounds):**
  - ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation)
  - Hemostasis and fluid resuscitation
  - Emergency laparotomy for signs of peritoneal hemorrhage, peritonitis, active bleeding
  - Non-surgical management based on clinical and radiologic evidence
  - Tetanus prophylaxis, broad-spectrum antibiotics, analgesics, anxiolytics
- **Blunt trauma:**
  - ABCs and cervical spine protection
  - Aggressive fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion if needed
  - Immediate laparotomy for signs of peritonitis, frank bleeding, or clinical deterioration
  - Angiography and embolization therapy as alternatives to laparotomy

**Critical Considerations**
- **Penetrating trauma (gunshot wounds):**
  - Bullet trajectory and organ involvement are unpredictable.
  - Operative intervention should not be delayed for diagnostic testing in unstable patients.
- **Blunt trauma:**
  - Consideration of mechanism of injury and associated risks (e.g., motor vehicle speed, substance use)
  - Potential for delayed presentation of symptoms and complications

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Gunshot wounds account for up to 90% of mortality in penetrating abdominal injuries.
- Blunt trauma is commonly caused by motor vehicle accidents.
- Pathophysiology involves damage to internal organs, potential for hemoperitoneum, and life-threatening hemorrhage.
- Racial disparities and higher incidence in males aged 20â€“24 years.
