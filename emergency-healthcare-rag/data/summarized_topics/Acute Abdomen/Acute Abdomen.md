# Acute Abdomen

**Definition/Overview**
- Acute abdomen refers to the sudden onset of severe abdominal pain that may indicate a serious or life-threatening condition requiring urgent evaluation and intervention.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Sudden abdominal pain
- Fever
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Abdominal distension
- Signs of peritonitis (guarding, rebound tenderness)
- Shock
- Absent bowel sounds

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Detailed pain description (location, radiation, timing, quality, severity)
- Vital signs measurement
- Complete abdominal examination (inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation)
- Laboratory tests (CBC, electrolytes, aminotransferases, lipase, amylase)
- Imaging (ultrasound, CT, MRI as indicated)
- Special considerations for pediatric patients (e.g., abdominal radiographs for suspected necrotizing enterocolitis)

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Appendicitis
- Perforated peptic ulcer
- Acute pancreatitis
- Cholecystitis
- Diverticulitis
- Ovarian torsion
- Volvulus
- Small bowel obstruction
- Ischemic bowel
- Ectopic pregnancy
- Pyelonephritis
- Necrotizing enterocolitis (in infants)

**Treatment Options**
- Resuscitation with IV fluids, vasopressors for shock
- Analgesia (acetaminophen, ketorolac, opioids)
- Antibiotics for suspected infection
- Surgical intervention for conditions like appendicitis, cholecystitis, bowel obstruction, perforation
- Specialty consultation as needed (surgery, gynecology, urology, gastroenterology)

**Critical Considerations**
- Urgent evaluation for signs of peritonitis, shock, or life-threatening conditions
- Adequate pain management without delaying diagnosis
- Immediate specialty referral for conditions like ruptured ectopic pregnancy, testicular torsion, ovarian torsion

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Accounts for 7-10% of emergency department visits
- Higher incidence in males
- Common causes vary by age group
- Pathophysiology involves visceral, somatoparietal, or referred pain depending on the pain receptors involved

**Formatting Rules**
- Use bolded section headers
- Bullet points under all sections except the overview
- Maintain clinical tone and terminology precision
- Exclude general background information unless necessary for diagnosis
