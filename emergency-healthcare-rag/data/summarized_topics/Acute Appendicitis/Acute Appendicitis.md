# Acute Appendicitis

**Definition/Overview**
- Acute appendicitis is the inflammation of the vermiform appendix, often leading to abdominal surgery, especially in children.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Diffuse or periumbilical pain localizing to the right lower quadrant
- Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malaise
- Urinary frequency or urgency
- Fever (approximately 40% of patients)
- Localized guarding, rebound tenderness at McBurney point
- Positive Dunphy, Rovsing, and psoas signs

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Laboratory: Leukocytosis (>10,000 cells/mm3), left shift, elevated CRP
- Imaging: CT scan with criteria including enlarged appendix (>6 mm diameter), wall thickening (>2 mm), periappendiceal fat stranding, appendicolith presence
- Ultrasound: Non-compressible appendix with diameter >6 mm, appendicolith, increased periappendiceal fat echogenicity
- MRI: Luminal distension, wall thickening, periappendiceal fluid (especially in pregnant patients)
- Alvarado score: Utilizes clinical and laboratory findings to estimate the likelihood of appendicitis

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Crohn ileitis, mesenteric adenitis, cecal diverticulum, mittelschmerz, salpingitis, ruptured ovarian cyst, ectopic pregnancy, tubo-ovarian abscess, pelvic inflammatory disease, gastroenteritis, renal colic, irritable bowel disease, testicular/ovarian torsion, and others

**Treatment Options**
- Medical: Antibiotics targeting aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (ceftriaxone/cefotaxime + metronidazole/clindamycin)
- Surgical: Appendectomy (laparoscopic preferred), with open appendectomy for complicated cases or when laparoscopic is not feasible
- Alternative techniques: NOTES, SILS, percutaneous drainage for abscesses

**Critical Considerations**
- Risk of perforation increases with time; early intervention is crucial
- Complications: Surgical site infections, abscess, peritonitis, sepsis, stump appendicitis
- Postoperative care: Antibiotics for complicated cases, wound management, avoidance of strenuous activity

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Incidence: 100-223 cases per 100,000 individuals annually
- Age range: 5-45 years, slight male predominance
- Pathophysiology: Luminal obstruction leads to increased pressure, ischemia, necrosis, and potential perforation
- Bacterial overgrowth with organisms like _E. coli_, _Bacteroides spp._

**Histopathology**
- Suppurative or phlegmonous: Neutrophil infiltration, ulceration, abscesses
- Gangrenous: Necrosis, potential perforation
- Periappendicitis: Serosal and subserosal inflammation
- Complicated appendicitis: Phlegmon, gangrenous changes, perforation, abscess formation
