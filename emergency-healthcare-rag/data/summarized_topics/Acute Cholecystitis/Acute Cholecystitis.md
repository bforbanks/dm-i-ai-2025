# Acute Cholecystitis

**Definition/Overview**
- Acute cholecystitis is the inflammation of the gallbladder, typically due to cystic duct obstruction, often by gallstones (calculous cholecystitis) or from other causes such as bile stasis and hypoperfusion (acalculous cholecystitis).

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Right upper quadrant pain
- Fever
- Nausea and vomiting
- Positive Murphy's sign (sudden stop in inspiration due to pain when the gallbladder is palpated)
- Leukocytosis
- Elevated liver enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, direct bilirubin)
- Gallbladder wall thickening on imaging

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and lipase levels
- Ultrasound: Gallbladder wall thickening >3 mm, pericholecystic fluid
- HIDA scan: Ejection fraction â‰¤35% or non-filling of gallbladder
- CT scan: Gallbladder wall thickening, edema, and pericholecystic fluid without gallstones

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Biliary colic
- Choledocholithiasis
- Cholangitis
- Pancreatitis
- Hepatitis
- Gastritis
- Peptic Ulcer Disease
- Appendicitis
- Mesenteric ischemia

**Treatment Options**
- Fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics
- Percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement for unstable patients
- Laparoscopic cholecystectomy as definitive treatment
- ERCP with cystic duct stent placement as an alternative to percutaneous drainage

**Critical Considerations**
- Rapid progression to gangrene or perforation if untreated
- ICU patients may require stabilization before surgery
- Postoperative antibiotics if gangrene or perforation occurred

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Acalculous cholecystitis: 10% of acute cholecystitis cases, more common in critically ill, older, and frail patients
- Calculous cholecystitis: 95% of acute cholecystitis cases, associated with gallstones
- Pathophysiology involves cystic duct blockage leading to gallbladder wall ischemia and potential gangrene or perforation

**Complications**
- Gallbladder perforation
- Gangrene of the gallbladder
- Sepsis

**Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care**
- Discharge on the same day or the day after surgery
- Over-the-counter analgesics for pain management
- Possible temporary intolerance to fatty foods

**Consultations**
- General surgeon
- Gastroenterologist
- Radiologist

**Deterrence and Patient Education**
- Early mobilization, minimizing fasting, and monitoring in TPN or rapid weight loss cases to prevent acalculous cholecystitis
- Informing patients and families about potential complications and the importance of early recognition and management
