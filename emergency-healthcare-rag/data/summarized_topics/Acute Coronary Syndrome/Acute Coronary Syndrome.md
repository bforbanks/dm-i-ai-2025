# Acute Coronary Syndrome

**Definition/Overview**
Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) encompasses conditions such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and unstable angina, characterized by decreased blood flow to the heart muscle, often due to plaque rupture and thrombus formation.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Substernal chest pain, often described as crushing or pressure-like
- Pain radiating to the jaw and/or left arm
- Difficulty breathing, lightheadedness
- Isolated jaw or left arm pain, nausea, epigastric pain
- Diaphoresis, weakness
- Physical exam findings may include general distress, diaphoresis, normal or abnormal heart sounds, crackles in lungs, bilateral leg edema

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- ECG within 10 minutes of arrival to differentiate STEMI from NSTEMI/unstable angina
- Cardiac enzymes (troponin, CK-MB/CK ratio) to assess myocardial damage
- Chest x-ray, CBC, chemistry, liver function tests, and lipase to rule out other causes
- Consideration of aortic dissection and pulmonary emboli based on clinical presentation

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Acute pericarditis
- Anxiety disorders
- Aortic stenosis
- Asthma
- Dilated cardiomyopathy
- Gastroenteritis
- Esophagitis
- Hypertensive emergencies
- Myocarditis

**Treatment Options**
- Initial treatment: aspirin (300 mg), heparin bolus, IV heparin infusion, antiplatelet therapy (ticagrelor or clopidogrel)
- Supportive measures: morphine/fentanyl for pain, oxygen for hypoxia, nitroglycerin with caution
- Continuous cardiac monitoring
- STEMI: emergent catheterization and PCI within 90 minutes, or thrombolytic therapy if PCI is not available within 120 minutes
- NSTEMI/Unstable Angina: symptom control, urgent catheterization if pain persists, otherwise case-by-case decision for catheterization timing
- Beta-blockers, statins, ACE inhibitors unless contraindicated
- CABG or medical management for non-PCI candidates

**Critical Considerations**
- ECG progression and continuous monitoring for arrhythmias
- Complications such as CHF, hypotension with nitroglycerin use in inferior wall ischemia
- Contraindications for medications and interventions

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- CHD affects approximately 15.5 million in the U.S., with ACS always symptomatic
- Decreased blood flow to heart musculature due to plaque rupture, thrombus formation, or vasospasm
- Risk factors include smoking, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, male sex, physical inactivity, family obesity, poor nutrition, cocaine abuse, and family history of early myocardial infarction
