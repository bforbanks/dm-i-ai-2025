# Acute Kidney Injury

**Definition/Overview**
- Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), formerly acute renal failure, is a sudden and potentially reversible decline in renal function, indicated by increased serum creatinine or reduced urine output.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Decreased urine output (<0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours)
- Fluid retention, causing swelling in legs, ankles, or feet
- Shortness of breath
- Fatigue
- Confusion
- Nausea
- Weakness
- Irregular heartbeat
- Chest pain or pressure
- Seizures or coma in severe cases

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- KDIGO criteria for AKI:
  - Increase in serum creatinine by ≥0.3 mg/dL (≥26.5 μmol/L) within 48 hours
  - Increase in serum creatinine to ≥1.5 times baseline within the prior 7 days
  - Urine volume <0.5 mL/kg/h for ≥6 hours
- RIFLE criteria for AKI severity:
  - Risk: Creatinine ↑ 1.5x baseline, GFR ↓ 25%, or urine output <0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours
  - Injury: Creatinine ↑ 2x baseline, GFR ↓ 50%, or urine output <0.5 mL/kg/h for 12 hours
  - Failure: Creatinine ↑ 3x baseline, GFR ↓ 75%, creatinine ≥4.0, or urine output <0.5 mL/kg/h for 12 hours
  - Loss: Persistent AKI >4 weeks
  - ESRD: Kidney failure >3 months

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
- Hypovolemia
- Gastrointestinal bleeding
- Decreased cardiac output
- Urinary tract infection (UTI)
- Urinary obstruction
- Renal calculi

**Treatment Options**
- Fluid challenge to distinguish prerenal AKI
- Avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs
- Renal dose adjustment of medications
- Management of hyperkalemia:
  - Dietary restriction
  - Insulin with IV dextrose
  - Beta-agonists
  - Potassium-binding resins
  - Calcium gluconate for EKG changes
  - Dialysis if refractory
- Volume management with diuretics, typically IV furosemide
- Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) for severe cases (e.g., hyperkalemia, uremic pericarditis, pulmonary edema)
- Specific treatments based on etiology (e.g., vasoactive drugs for hepatorenal syndrome, immunosuppression for glomerulonephritis)

**Critical Considerations**
- Monitoring for post-obstructive diuresis after relief of obstruction
- Daily reevaluation of need for RRT
- Close monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Up to 7% of hospital admissions and 30% of ICU admissions develop AKI
- Pathophysiology varies by prerenal (e.g., hypovolemia, hypotension), intrinsic renal (e.g., acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis), and postrenal (e.g., obstruction) causes
- Rare presentations include unilateral obstruction without AKI due to compensatory contralateral kidney function

**Complications**
- Hyperkalemia leading to arrhythmias
- Metabolic acidosis requiring bicarbonate or citrate
- Hyperphosphatemia managed with dietary restriction or phosphate binders
- Volume overload causing pulmonary edema and peripheral edema
- Cardiovascular complications like heart failure and arrhythmias
- Gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea and GI bleeding
- Neurologic manifestations such as lethargy and cognitive impairment
