# Acute Liver Failure

**Definition/Overview**
Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rapid deterioration of liver function, characterized by encephalopathy and impaired synthetic function (INR ≥ 1.5) in patients without preexisting liver disease, occurring within 26 weeks of symptom onset.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Encephalopathy
- Coagulopathy (INR ≥ 1.5)
- Jaundice
- Hypotension
- Altered mental status
- Right upper quadrant discomfort
- Nausea
- Hypoglycemia

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- INR ≥ 1.5
- Elevated bilirubin and aminotransferases
- Thrombocytopenia, anemia
- Elevated serum ammonia
- Acute renal injury indicators (elevated serum creatinine)
- Dyselectrolytemia (e.g., hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia)
- Imaging for cirrhosis, portal hypertension, hepatocellular carcinoma, vascular thrombosis
- Brain imaging for cerebral edema
- Chest imaging for pulmonary complications

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Acute fatty liver of pregnancy
- Amanita phalloides mushroom poisoning
- Bacillus cereus toxin
- Fructose intolerance
- Galactosemia
- HELLP syndrome
- Hemorrhagic viruses (Ebola, Lassa, Marburg)
- Idiopathic drug reaction
- Neonatal iron storage disease
- Tyrosinemia

**Treatment Options**
- **Supportive Care**: Hemodynamic stabilization, blood product administration, empirical antibiotics, nutritional support, glucose maintenance, medication review.
- **Specific Treatments**: N-acetyl cysteine for acetaminophen toxicity, antivirals for viral hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune hepatitis, penicillin G for Amanita poisoning, anticoagulation and TIPS for Budd-Chiari syndrome, acyclovir for herpes hepatitis, ganciclovir for CMV, delivery for pregnancy-related ALF.
- **Complication Management**: Renal replacement therapy, broad-spectrum antibiotics, glucose and electrolyte management, intracranial pressure control, airway protection, coagulopathy management.
- **Liver Support/Transplantation**: Consideration of extracorporeal liver-assist devices, liver transplantation evaluation.

**Critical Considerations**
- Rapid progression to multi-organ failure
- Cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension risks
- Coagulopathy management without overt bleeding
- Liver transplantation criteria and urgency

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Etiology varies by region: drug-induced (acetaminophen) in developed countries, viral hepatitis in developing countries.
- Pathophysiology involves hepatocyte necrosis/apoptosis, ATP depletion, altered BBB, and systemic inflammatory response.
- Rare presentations include Wilson disease, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and atypical viral infections.
- Improved survival rates with intensive care and liver transplantation.
