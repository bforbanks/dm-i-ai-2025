# Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome

**Definition/Overview**
- Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening form of lung injury characterized by poor oxygenation, stiff lungs, and bilateral infiltrates, not attributable to cardiac failure.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Dyspnea
- Progressive hypoxemia
- Tachypnea
- Increased breathing effort
- Cyanosis
- Tachycardia
- Altered mental status
- Bibasilar rales on chest auscultation

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Acute onset within 7 days of an inciting event
- Bilateral lung infiltrates on chest radiography or CT scan
- PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300 mm Hg
- Presence of PEEP or CPAP ≥5 cm H2O
- Exclusion of cardiogenic pulmonary edema

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Cardiogenic edema
- Exacerbation of interstitial lung disease
- Acute interstitial pneumonia
- Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
- Acute eosinophilic lung disease
- Organizing pneumonia
- Bilateral pneumonia
- Pulmonary vasculitis
- Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia
- Disseminated malignancy

**Treatment Options**
- Mechanical ventilation with lung-protective strategy (ARDSnet protocol): TV 4-8 mL/kg IBW, RR ≤35 bpm, SpO2 88-95%, Pp <30 cm H2O, pH 7.30-7.45
- PEEP titration, potentially high levels up to 24 cm H2O
- Conservative fluid management post-resuscitation
- Prone positioning for at least 8 hours/day
- ECMO as salvage therapy for refractory hypoxemia
- Nutritional support, preferably enteral
- Glucocorticoids for specific indications (e.g., early refractory ARDS with PaO2/FiO2 <200 mm Hg)
- Prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis and stress ulcers
- Neuromuscular blockade in early ARDS to improve compliance and oxygenation

**Critical Considerations**
- Avoidance of volutrauma, barotrauma, and atelectrauma
- Differentiation of ARDS from cardiac causes of pulmonary edema
- Management of concurrent multi-organ failure
- Potential for rapid progression from mild to severe ARDS
- Risk of complications such as barotrauma, nosocomial infections, and muscle weakness

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Incidence: 64.2-78.9 cases/100,000 person-years in the US
- Mortality: 27-45% depending on ARDS severity
- Pathophysiology involves capillary endothelial injury, diffuse alveolar damage, inflammation, and increased alveolar-capillary permeability leading to edema and hypoxemia
- Disease phases: exudative, proliferative, and fibrotic
- Rare presentations include transient ECG patterns and uncommon vessels involved in pulmonary hypertension
