# Anaphylaxis

**Definition/Overview**
- Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction that is rapid, generalized, and multi-systemic.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Cutaneous: Flushing, pruritus, urticaria
- Respiratory: Dyspnea, wheezing, stridor, hypoxemia
- Cardiovascular: Hypotension (systolic <90 mm Hg or >30% decrease from baseline)
- Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, vomiting
- Neurological: Syncope, hypotonia, incontinence

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- **Clinical Criteria for Anaphylaxis (1 of the following with onset within minutes to hours):**
  - Unknown exposure: Urticaria or skin/mucosal symptoms + respiratory compromise or hypotension or end-organ dysfunction
  - Likely exposure: Symptoms involving â‰¥2 body systems (integumentary, respiratory, hypotension, gastrointestinal)
  - Known exposure: Hypotension (systolic <90 mm Hg or >30% decrease from baseline)

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Angioedema, anxiety, arrhythmias, asthma, carcinoid syndrome, epiglottitis, foreign-body airway obstruction, gastroenteritis, mastocytosis, myocardial ischemia/infarction, seizure, vasovagal episode, vocal cord dysfunction

**Treatment Options**
- **Epinephrine**: 0.3 to 0.5 mL of 1:1,000 IM (0.01 mg/kg for pediatrics), repeat every 5-10 minutes as needed
- **IV Fluid Resuscitation**: 1-2 L or 10-20 mL/kg isotonic crystalloid for hypotension
- **Corticosteroids**: Methylprednisolone (80 to 125 mg IV) or hydrocortisone (250 to 500 mg IV), followed by oral prednisone (40 to 60 mg daily) for 3-5 days
- **Antihistamines**: Diphenhydramine (25 to 50 mg IV/IM), famotidine (20 mg IV), or cimetidine (300 mg IV)
- **Bronchodilators**: Inhaled beta-agonists (e.g., albuterol)
- **Vasopressors**: As needed for hypotensive shock
- **Glucagon**: For beta-blocker reversal if resistant to epinephrine

**Critical Considerations**
- Rapid onset within 1 hour of exposure, with potential for biphasic reactions peaking 8-11 hours later
- Airway management is critical due to risk of laryngeal edema
- Continuous monitoring for at least 4 hours post-treatment

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Lifetime prevalence of 1% to 3%, increasing in younger populations and developed countries
- IgE-mediated (type 1) hypersensitivity with mast cell/basophil degranulation releasing histamine, tryptase, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, platelet-activating factors, and TNF-alpha
- Rare variants include alpha-gal anaphylaxis (IgE response to mammalian galactose alpha-1,3-galactose)

**Contraindications & Warnings**
- Caution with intravenous epinephrine due to risk of cardiovascular complications
- Monitor beta-blocked patients closely due to unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects
- Avoid gastric lavage for ingested allergens
- Kounis syndrome: myocardial infarction or ischemia during anaphylaxis

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Prevalence: 1% to 3% lifetime risk, increasing globally
- Pathophysiology: IgE-mediated hypersensitivity, mast cell/basophil degranulation, mediator release (histamine, tryptase, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, TNF-alpha)
- Rare presentations: Alpha-gal anaphylaxis, idiopathic anaphylaxis
