# Angiography (invasive)

**Definition/Overview**
- Angiography is an imaging technique used to visualize the vascular system, including cardiac chambers, by injecting contrast material and capturing its flow through vessels on X-ray or CT images. It serves both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes and is considered the gold standard for many intravascular pathologies.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Not applicable (angiography is a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure, not a condition with symptoms).

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Visualization of vascular anatomy and pathology via contrast-enhanced X-ray or CT images
- Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) technique for image acquisition
- Assessment of degree of stenosis and other abnormalities by visual inspection of images

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Differentiated from non-invasive imaging modalities like CT angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) based on resolution, invasiveness, and ability to offer therapeutic interventions

**Treatment Options**
- Therapeutic interventions during angiography may include stent placement, occlusive aortic balloon deployment, mechanical thrombectomy, transarterial chemoembolization, and others
- Access via femoral or radial artery, depending on the procedure
- Use of guide wires and catheters to navigate to the target vessel
- Injection of contrast medium to delineate vasculature

**Critical Considerations**
- Risk of complications such as bleeding, hematoma, false aneurysm, allergic reactions, and acute renal failure
- Contrast-induced nephropathy prevention with adequate hydration and minimal contrast volume
- Maximal acceptable contrast dose (MACD) and contrast volume to creatinine clearance (CCC) ratio considerations

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Invasive angiography remains essential despite the rise of non-invasive techniques due to its high-resolution imaging and therapeutic capabilities
- Pathophysiological understanding of vascular diseases guides the use of angiography for diagnosis and intervention

**Contraindications**
- Absolute: Morbid obesity beyond the weight limit of the angiography table
- Relative: Pregnancy, severe iodinated contrast allergy, renal impairment, coagulopathy, diabetes on metformin, inability to lie still

**Equipment**
- Catheters, guide wires, autoinjector, image intensifying screen, sliding table, remote computerized equipment, biplane C-arm digital imaging, generator

**Personnel**
- Led by clinicians specialized in interventional radiology, vascular surgery, interventional neuroradiology, or interventional cardiology
- Supported by angiography lab nurses and radiology technicians with critical care and cardiovascular monitoring skills

**Preparation**
- Individualized based on patient characteristics and type of angiography
- Hydration to minimize nephrotoxicity risk
- Fasting for 6-8 hours as needed
- Evaluation of renal function, medication review, and allergy history

**Technique or Treatment**
- Access via femoral or radial artery
- Use of guide wires and catheters to navigate to the target vessel
- Injection of contrast medium to delineate vasculature
- Imaging techniques include DSA, with specific views for thoracic and abdominal aorta

**Complications**
- Minor: Bruising, nausea, pain, minor allergic reactions, transient renal function deterioration
- Major: Significant bleeding, hematoma, false aneurysm, anaphylactoid reaction, acute renal failure
- Contrast-induced nephropathy prevention strategies

**Clinical Significance**
- Invasive angiography is crucial for therapeutic interventions like PCI, mechanical thrombectomy, and stenting
- Non-invasive CTA and MRA are alternatives for diagnostic purposes but lack the therapeutic capabilities of invasive angiography
- Angiographic-derived physiology metrics offer high accuracy compared to invasive pressure wire-derived FFR
