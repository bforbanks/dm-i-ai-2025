# Aortic Dissection

**Definition/Overview**
- Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition characterized by a tear in the aortic wall, creating a false lumen that can lead to severe complications like aortic rupture and organ ischemia.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Sudden, severe, "tearing" chest or back pain
- Blood pressure discrepancies between arms (>20 mm Hg)
- Pulse deficits
- Diastolic murmur suggesting aortic insufficiency
- Neurological deficits (e.g., stroke-like symptoms, limb weakness)
- Syncope

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** Nonspecific, may show ST-segment changes
- **Chest Radiography:** Widened mediastinum, abnormal aortic contour, pleural effusion
- **Laboratory Evaluation:** Elevated D-dimer (>500 ng/mL), mildly elevated troponin, leukocytosis, renal function tests
- **Imaging Modalities:**
  - **CTA:** First-line, shows intimal flap, true and false lumens
  - **TEE:** High-resolution images of aortic root and ascending aorta
  - **MRI:** For follow-up and contraindications to iodinated contrast
  - **TTE:** For acute aortic syndromes and complications assessment
  - **Aortography:** Rarely used, for endovascular stent planning

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Myocardial infarction
- Aortic aneurysm
- Cardiac tamponade
- Esophageal rupture
- Spontaneous pneumothorax
- Pulmonary embolism
- Stroke or transient ischemic attack

**Treatment Options**
- **Stanford type A dissections:** Urgent surgical intervention, aortic replacement, aortic valve repair/replacement
- **Stanford type B dissections:** Medical management, endovascular stent-grafting (TEVAR) for complications
- **Medical therapy:** Analgesia (morphine), heart rate and blood pressure control (beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitroprusside)

**Critical Considerations**
- Rapid progression and high mortality without treatment
- Complications: aortic rupture, cardiac tamponade, organ ischemia
- Endoleaks post-EVAR: regular imaging follow-up

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Incidence: 5 to 30 cases per 1 million people per year
- Risk factors: Hypertension, genetic conditions (Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), atherosclerosis
- Pathophysiology: Tear in intimal layer, blood enters between intima and media, cystic medial degeneration

**Prognosis**
- High mortality without treatment, especially for Stanford type A dissections
- Long-term risks: redissection, aneurysm formation, cardiovascular events
- Better outcomes in high-volume centers with interprofessional teams

**Complications**
- Multiorgan failure, stroke, myocardial infarction, paraplegia, renal failure, amputation, bowel ischemia, tamponade, acute aortic regurgitation, death

**Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care**
- Lifelong antihypertensive therapy, regular imaging surveillance, lifestyle modifications, management of late complications

**Deterrence and Patient Education**
- Risk factor modification, awareness of symptoms, adherence to medical therapy, long-term monitoring, genetic counseling, psychosocial support, emergency plans
