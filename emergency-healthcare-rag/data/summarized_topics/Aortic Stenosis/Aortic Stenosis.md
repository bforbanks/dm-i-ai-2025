# Aortic Stenosis

**Definition/Overview**
- Aortic stenosis is a valvular disorder characterized by left ventricular outflow obstruction, commonly due to congenital abnormalities, calcification, or rheumatic disease, leading to progressive symptoms and heart failure.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Exertional dyspnea
- Fatigue
- Chest pain (angina)
- Syncope
- Heart failure symptoms (e.g., orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea)
- Pulsus parvus et tardus (slow-rising, late-peaking carotid pulse)
- Mid-systolic ejection murmur
- Decreased exercise tolerance

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Echocardiography: valve anatomy, severity of calcification, orifice area
- Cardiac CT/MRI: when echocardiography is inconclusive
- Exercise testing: for asymptomatic patients, contraindicated in symptomatic patients
- ECG: may show signs of left ventricular hypertrophy

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Cardiomyopathy
- Coronary artery disease
- Pulmonary disease
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- Aortic sclerosis
- Subvalvular stenosis
- Supravalvular stenosis (e.g., Williams syndrome)

**Treatment Options**
- Aortic valve replacement (AVR): indicated for symptomatic patients or asymptomatic patients with LVEF <50%, undergoing other heart surgery, abnormal exercise test, peak velocity >5 m/sec, mean pressure gradient >60 mm Hg, or rapid progression
- Medical therapy: limited role, but may include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics for symptom relief
- Balloon aortic valvuloplasty: temporary relief
- Surgical AVR: choice for many patients, with operative mortality around 3.2%
- Transcatheter AVR: for high-risk or inoperable patients, with expanding indications

**Critical Considerations**
- ECG progression: signs of left ventricular hypertrophy
- Complications: sudden death, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, conduction abnormalities, infective endocarditis, GI bleeding, cerebral/systemic emboli
- Prognosis: poor in symptomatic patients without intervention, survival 1-3 years post-symptom onset

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Prevalence: 1-2% in patients <65 years, 29% in patients â‰¥65 years, severe aortic stenosis in 2-9% of patients >75 years
- Pathophysiology: LV obstruction increases systolic pressure and mass, leading to dysfunction and failure; myocardial oxygen consumption increases, perfusion time decreases
- Rare variants: unicuspid valve, supravalvular/subvalvular stenosis, associated with genetic syndromes like Williams syndrome
