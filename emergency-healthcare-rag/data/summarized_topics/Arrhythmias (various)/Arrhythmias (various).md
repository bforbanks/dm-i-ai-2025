# Arrhythmias (various)

**Definition/Overview**
- Arrhythmias are disorders of heart rate and rhythm, categorized into bradyarrhythmias (<60 bpm) and tachyarrhythmias (>100 bpm), with further classification based on origin, transmission, and associated syndromes.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Palpitations
- Syncope
- Shortness of breath
- Chest pain
- Irregular pulse

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- ECG is the primary diagnostic tool, showing:
  - Bradyarrhythmias: Slow heart rate, potential AV block
  - Tachyarrhythmias: Fast heart rate, QRS complex duration (<120 ms for narrow, â‰¥120 ms for wide)
  - Supraventricular Tachycardias (SVTs): Narrow QRS complex, potentially rapid atrial rates
  - Ventricular Tachycardias (VTs): Wide QRS complex, ventricular rate >100 bpm
  - Ventricular Fibrillation (VF): Irregular rhythm, rate >300 bpm, no discernible waves
- Ambulatory EKG, event recorders, loop recorders, and implantable loop recorders for intermittent symptoms
- Echocardiogram and angiogram for structural heart disease
- Electrophysiology study (EPS) for arrhythmia mechanism

**Differential Diagnosis**
- SVT vs. VT: Based on QRS width and origin
- VF vs. PEA/asystole: Managed differently, VF is shockable
- Other conditions mimicking VF: Polymorphic VT, Torsade de pointes, Ventricular flutter, SVT with aberrancy

**Treatment Options**
- **Acute Management**:
  - Immediate defibrillation for VF/VT
  - ACLS protocol adherence
  - Epinephrine and amiodarone administration
  - Correct reversible causes (electrolytes, acidosis, hypoxia)
- **Preventative Management**:
  - ICD for primary and secondary prevention of SCD
  - Antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., amiodarone, beta-blockers)
  - Statins and beta-blockers for risk reduction
- **Post-Resuscitation Care**:
  - Coronary angiography for ischemic heart disease
  - EPS for inducible arrhythmias
  - Genetic testing for inherited arrhythmia syndromes

**Critical Considerations**
- VF requires immediate defibrillation; delay reduces survival rates.
- Differentiating SVT from VT is crucial for appropriate management.
- ICDs significantly improve survival in patients at risk for SCD.
- Post-resuscitation care includes addressing reversible causes and assessing for structural heart disease.

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Prevalence: 1.5% to 5% in the general population, with atrial fibrillation being the most common.
- Pathophysiology involves abnormal impulse formation (automaticity, triggered activity) and conduction (reentry circuits).
- VF is often associated with structural heart disease, electrolyte imbalances, and genetic predispositions.
