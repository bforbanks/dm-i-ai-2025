# Arterial Blood Gas (ABG)

**Definition/Overview**
- Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) analysis is a critical diagnostic tool for assessing a patient's acid-base balance, oxygenation, and ventilation status, particularly in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Not applicable as ABG is a diagnostic test, not a condition with symptoms.

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- **pH**: 7.35-7.45 (acidemia if <7.35, alkalemia if >7.45)
- **PaO2**: 75-100 mm Hg (hypoxemia if <80 mm Hg)
- **PaCO2**: 35-45 mm Hg (hypercapnia if >45 mm Hg, hypocapnia if <35 mm Hg)
- **HCO3-**: 22-26 mmol/L (metabolic acidosis if decreased, metabolic alkalosis if increased)
- **Base excess/deficit**: -2 to +2 mmol/L (metabolic acidosis if negative, metabolic alkalosis if positive)
- **SaO2**: 95-100% (hypoxemia if <95%)

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Respiratory vs. metabolic acidosis/alkalosis, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, hypocapnia, and mixed disorders.

**Treatment Options**
- Adjustments in mechanical ventilation settings based on ABG results:
  - **Hypoxemia**: Increase FiO2 and/or PEEP.
  - **Hypercapnia**: Increase respiratory rate and/or tidal volume.
  - **Acidosis**: Address underlying cause; may require increased ventilation.
  - **Alkalosis**: Adjust ventilation to allow for CO2 retention if respiratory in origin; address underlying metabolic cause if metabolic in origin.

**Critical Considerations**
- Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings based on ABG results to prevent complications.
- Consideration of special circumstances such as COPD, ARDS, asthma, restrictive lung diseases, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- ABG analysis is used across various clinical settings, including emergency medicine, intensive care, anesthesiology, and pulmonology.
- Pathophysiology includes understanding the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, shunt fraction, and pulmonary dead space in relation to lung function and gas exchange.
