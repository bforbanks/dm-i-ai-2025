# Aspiration Pneumonia

**Definition/Overview**
- Aspiration pneumonia is an infectious pulmonary condition caused by the inhalation of bacteria-rich fluids, particulate matter, or gastric content into the lower respiratory tract, primarily affecting older adults and those with swallowing dysfunction.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Cough
- Fever
- Malaise
- Dyspnea
- Hypoxemia

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Radiological evidence of alveolar infiltrates, particularly in dependent lung areas
- Clinical history of dysphagia or aspiration events
- Laboratory signs of infection (elevated WBC count)
- Videofluoroscopy swallowing study (VFSS) for definitive aspiration confirmation

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Aspiration pneumonitis
- Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
- Viral pneumonia
- Negative-pressure pulmonary edema

**Treatment Options**
- Empiric treatment for CAP
- Oxygen supplementation to maintain target saturation
- Antibiotics such as ampicillin/sulbactam, carbapenems, or respiratory fluoroquinolones
- Minimum of 5 days of therapy, longer for complicated cases

**Critical Considerations**
- Anaerobic coverage is not routinely recommended
- Risk of _Clostridium difficile_ colitis with clindamycin use
- Glucocorticoids not beneficial in treatment
- Ensure adequate oxygenation and nutritional support

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Prevalence varies, with higher rates in older adults and those with neurological disorders
- Pathophysiology involves impaired swallow or cough reflexes and bacterial colonization of oropharyngeal secretions
- Polymicrobial infections with aerobic gram-negative bacilli as predominant pathogens

**Contraindications & Warnings**
- Avoid unnecessary antibiotic use and anaerobic coverage unless indicated
- Monitor for complications such as lung abscesses, empyema, malnutrition, and dehydration

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Older adults, especially those with comorbidities, are at higher risk
- Pathophysiology involves impaired defense mechanisms and bacterial colonization
- Rare presentations include unusual infiltrate locations depending on patient mobility and position during aspiration

**Deterrence & Patient Education**
- Regular dysphagia screening and management
- Oral hygiene to reduce bacterial load
- Modified diets and postural techniques to reduce aspiration risk
- Enteral feeding considerations for prolonged inadequate oral intake
