# Asthma Exacerbation

**Definition/Overview**
- Asthma exacerbation is an acute or subacute episode of progressive worsening of symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness, often triggered by allergens, respiratory infections, or environmental factors.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Increased frequency and intensity of cough
- Worsening wheezing
- Increased shortness of breath
- Chest tightness
- Difficulty speaking in full sentences
- Use of accessory muscles for breathing
- Tachypnea and tachycardia

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Decreased peak expiratory flow (PEF)
- Reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)
- Hypoxemia on pulse oximetry
- Possible hypercapnia in severe cases
- Chest x-ray may show hyperinflation during severe exacerbations

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
- Heart failure
- Pulmonary embolism
- Vocal cord dysfunction
- Foreign body aspiration
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

**Treatment Options**
- Short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) such as albuterol
- Oral corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone)
- Oxygen supplementation for hypoxemia
- Inhaled anticholinergics (e.g., ipratropium) for severe cases
- Intravenous magnesium sulfate for life-threatening exacerbations
- Intubation and mechanical ventilation in cases of respiratory failure

**Critical Considerations**
- Rapid assessment and treatment are crucial to prevent progression to respiratory failure.
- Close monitoring of respiratory status, PEF, and response to treatment.
- Consideration of potential triggers and patient's adherence to asthma management plan.

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Asthma affects approximately 7% of Americans.
- Pathophysiology involves airway inflammation, bronchoconstriction, and increased mucus production.
- Risk factors include atopy, genetic predisposition, and environmental exposures.
- Rare variants may include occupational asthma and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD).
