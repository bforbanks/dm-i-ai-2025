# Atrial Fibrillation

**Definition/Overview**
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, characterized by abnormal electrical activity in the atria, leading to a fast and irregular heartbeat. It significantly increases the risk of stroke and can be paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent, or permanent.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Palpitations
- Chest pain
- Shortness of breath
- Tachycardia
- Dizziness
- Diaphoresis
- Generalized fatigue
- Irregularly irregular pulse
- Signs of heart failure (e.g., edema, rales)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- ECG: Absent P-waves, irregularly irregular rhythm, narrow QRS complex, ventricular rate typically 80-180/min
- Lab tests: CBC, BMP, thyroid function tests, cardiac biomarkers, BNP
- Imaging: Chest x-ray, transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) for atrial thrombus
- Risk stratification: CHA2DS2-VASc score, HAS-BLED score

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Atrial flutter
- Atrial tachycardia
- Multifocal atrial tachycardia
- Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
- Atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia

**Treatment Options**
- Hemodynamically unstable: Immediate cardioversion with anticoagulation
- Rate control: Beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, digoxin (not first-line)
- Rhythm control: Amiodarone, dronedarone (consult cardiology)
- Anticoagulation: Oral anticoagulants (NOACs preferred over warfarin, except in valvular AF)
- Non-pharmacological: Ablation therapy, pacemaker placement, weight loss in obese patients
- Stroke prevention: TEE before cardioversion, left atrial appendage occlusion in select cases

**Critical Considerations**
- Anticoagulation before and after cardioversion if AF >48 hours or unknown duration
- Monitor renal and liver function with NOACs
- Reversal agents for anticoagulant-related bleeding (idarucizumab for dabigatran, andexanet alfa for rivaroxaban and apixaban)

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Prevalence increases with age, more common in males and whites
- Pathophysiology involves cardiac remodeling, genetic factors, and triggers such as atrial ischemia and inflammation
- Types: Paroxysmal (self-terminating), persistent (requires intervention), long-standing persistent (>12 months), and permanent (no further rhythm control attempted)
- CHA2DS2-VASc score used for stroke risk assessment

**Prognosis**
AF is associated with increased morbidity and mortality due to thromboembolism, with rhythm control not showing a survival advantage over rate control. Management costs are substantial, impacting patient quality of life.

**Complications**
- Stroke (CVA)
- Heart disease
- Heart failure
