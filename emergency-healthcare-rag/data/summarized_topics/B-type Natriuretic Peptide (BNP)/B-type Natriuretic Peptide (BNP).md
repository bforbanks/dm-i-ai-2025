# B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP)

**Definition/Overview**
- B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a cardiac hormone involved in blood pressure regulation and heart function, primarily released from ventricular cells in response to ventricular distention.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Dyspnea
- Signs of volume overload (e.g., peripheral edema, pulmonary rales)
- Elevated jugular venous pressure

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- BNP levels >100 pg/mL suggest heart failure.
- NT-proBNP levels >300 pg/mL in acutely dyspneic patients suggest heart failure.
- BNP half-life: ~20 minutes; NT-proBNP half-life: ~120 minutes.
- Age-adjusted normal thresholds: BNP <100 pg/mL; NT-proBNP <450 pg/mL (<50 years), <900 pg/mL (>50 years).

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Acute coronary syndrome
- Right ventricular failure
- Acute myocardial infarction
- Congenital heart disease
- Valvular disease
- Sepsis
- Anemia
- Renal dysfunction
- Cushing syndrome
- Hyperaldosteronism
- Hypertension with left ventricular hypertrophy
- Cirrhosis

**Treatment Options**
- Treatment is based on the underlying cause of BNP elevation (e.g., heart failure management, addressing volume overload, or treating comorbid conditions).

**Critical Considerations**
- BNP levels influenced by renal function, age, sex, and body mass index.
- BNP assays must be characterized for pre-analytical and analytical variables.
- BNP is labile; requires EDTA tubes and testing within four hours of collection or appropriate storage conditions.

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- BNP gene expression increases in cardiac diseases affecting ventricles.
- BNP binds to natriuretic peptide receptors, causing diuresis, natriuresis, and vasodilation.
- Elevated BNP levels correlate with heart failure severity, prognosis, and mortality.
- BNP production can be stimulated by inflammatory cytokines.

**Specimen Requirements and Procedure**
- BNP is collected in EDTA tubes, ideally tested within four hours, or stored at 2-8Â°C for some assays.
- NT-proBNP is more stable, can be tested in serum/plasma, and stored refrigerated for three days.

**Testing Procedures**
- BNP and NT-proBNP levels are determined by immunoassays.
- Point-of-care BNP assays are available, providing results in approximately 15 minutes.

**Interfering Factors**
- Comorbidities such as chronic renal failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and acute coronary syndrome can affect BNP levels.
- BNP/NT-proBNP levels are higher in renal failure and diabetes, lower in obesity.
- Assay cross-reactivity with proBNP and glycosylated forms must be considered.

**Results, Reporting, and Critical Findings**
- BNP >100 pg/mL and NT-proBNP >300 pg/mL in dyspneic patients warrant further cardiac assessment.
- BNP levels vary by age, sex, and are influenced by renal function and BMI.

**Clinical Significance**
- BNP is a sensitive marker for differentiating cardiogenic from non-cardiogenic dyspnea.
- Elevated BNP levels indicate the need for further cardiac workup.
- BNP levels are prognostic in chronic heart failure and post-myocardial infarction left ventricular dysfunction.

**Quality Control and Lab Safety**
- Quality control measures include analyzing control materials, using Westgard multi-rules, and adhering to safety protocols for handling and disposing of potentially infectious materials.
