# Blood Cultures

**Definition/Overview**
- Bacteremia refers to the presence of viable bacteria in the blood, which can range from transient and asymptomatic to severe bloodstream infections like septicemia.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Fever
- Chills and/or rigors
- Hypotension
- Altered mental status
- Decreased urine output
- Signs of organ-specific involvement (e.g., ARDS, AKI)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Lactate level assessment
- Blood cultures: ideally two sets for aerobic and anaerobic organisms from each arm
- Imaging: chest x-ray, CT scans for surgical patients, urinalysis with culture
- Culture of surgical sites, sputum, or indwelling catheter tips if applicable

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Acute prostatitis/abscess
- Community-acquired pneumonia (with asplenia)
- Deep neck space infection abscess
- Empyema
- Instrumentation in patients with bacteriuria
- Intra- or perinephric abscess
- Lung abscess
- Peritonitis abscess
- Pyelonephritis
- Renal calculi
- Renal insufficiency
- Urinary tract obstruction

**Treatment Options**
- Immediate empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., extended-generation cephalosporins, beta-lactamase inhibitors, vancomycin for MRSA)
- Adjust antibiotics based on Gram stain and antimicrobial susceptibility
- Treatment duration: 7-14 days, parenteral administration
- Transition to oral agents when afebrile for 48 hours and clinically stable

**Critical Considerations**
- Timely administration of appropriate antibiotics to reduce morbidity and mortality
- Removal and culture of indwelling catheter tips when indicated
- Monitoring for progression to SIRS, sepsis, septic shock, MODS

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Prevalence influenced by geographic region, patient demographics, drug resistance, and institutional practices
- Common sources: respiratory tract, indwelling catheters, urinary tract infections
- Pathogens: _Escherichia coli_ (gram-negative), _Staphylococcus aureus_ (gram-positive)
- Host immune response and defense barriers are critical in infection progression or clearance
