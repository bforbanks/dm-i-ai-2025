# Blunt Trauma

**Definition/Overview**
- Acute acoustic trauma (AAT) is sudden sensorineural hearing loss from intense impulse noise exposure, typically exceeding 140 dB for less than 0.2 seconds.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Hearing loss
- Tinnitus
- Otalgia
- Vertigo
- Hyperacusis

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Audiometric evaluation: threshold shifts, especially at high frequencies (2-6 kHz)
- Otomicroscopy: to assess tympanic membrane and ossicular chain
- Audiological tests: tympanometry, speech discrimination, acoustic reflexes
- Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs): for cochlear function
- Auditory brainstem response audiometry: for retrocochlear pathology

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Sudden sensorineural hearing loss
- Inner ear or cochleovestibular nerve injury from head trauma
- Posterior circulation cerebrovascular accident
- Viral infections
- Autoimmune diseases
- Ototoxicity from chemotherapy
- Neurological disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis)
- Ménière disease

**Treatment Options**
- Corticosteroids: intravenous, oral, or transtympanic
- Antioxidants and neurotrophins: potential acute treatment
- Hyperbaric oxygen therapy: especially if steroids are ineffective
- Hearing protection devices (HPDs): passive and active
- Avoid further noise exposure
- Otolaryngology referral for complications

**Critical Considerations**
- Early intervention is crucial for hearing preservation
- Steroid treatment should ideally start within 24-72 hours post-exposure
- Hearing recovery is unpredictable and varies by individual
- Continued exposure to noise can worsen outcomes

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Prevalence: significant in military personnel, underdiagnosed in civilians
- Pathophysiology: mechanical and metabolic injuries to auditory system, cochlear inflammation, oxidative stress, damage to stereocilia, and hair cells
- Rare presentations: damage to middle ear muscles (stapedius, tensor tympani), leading to hyperacusis and fluttering sensations
