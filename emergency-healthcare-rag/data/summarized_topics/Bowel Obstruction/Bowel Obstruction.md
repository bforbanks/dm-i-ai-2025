# Bowel Obstruction

**Definition/Overview**
- Large Bowel Obstruction (LBO) is a critical condition often necessitating emergency intervention due to risks such as sepsis, dehydration, and hemodynamic instability.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Abdominal pain
- Distension
- Lack of bowel movements
- Severe distension and pain in closed-loop obstructions
- Progressive right iliac fossa pain indicating impending cecal perforation

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Laboratory tests for anemia, infection, renal function, and electrolytes
- Imaging: supine and upright/decubitus x-rays, CT scans with intravenous contrast (oral contrast contraindicated), water-soluble rectal contrast for further clarification
- Colonoscopy for tissue diagnosis

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Mechanical causes: neoplastic, neurogenic, inflammatory, mechanical within the colon, extrinsic factors
- Functional causes: pseudo-obstruction

**Treatment Options**
- Initial: fluid resuscitation, metabolic dysfunction correction, nasogastric tube insertion for decompression
- Surgical: emergency surgery for peritonitis, ischemia, sepsis, shock; stenting as a bridge to surgery or for palliation; resection with anastomosis for curative oncologic management

**Critical Considerations**
- Prompt intervention to reduce morbidity and manage complications
- Monitoring for ECG progression, complications, and contraindications
- Considerations for stenting, including indications, methods, risks, and alternatives

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Increasing incidence in young adults
- Pathophysiology involves distension leading to venous outflow impediment, arterial inflow compromise, ischemia, necrosis, and perforation

**Formatting Rules**
- Maintain clinical tone and terminology precision
- Exclude general background unless needed for triage/diagnosis
- Use bullet points under all sections except the overview
