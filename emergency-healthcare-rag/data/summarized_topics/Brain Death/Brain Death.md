# Brain Death

**Definition/Overview**
- Brain death is the irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brainstem, as defined by the Uniform Determination of Death Act (UDDA).

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Coma (complete lack of consciousness)
- Absence of brainstem reflexes
- Apnea (lack of spontaneous breathing)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Etiology of coma must be known, excluding reversible causes.
- Core temperature >36 Â°C.
- Systolic blood pressure (SBP) >100 mm Hg.
- Absence of all brainstem reflexes (pupillary, oculocephalic, corneal, gag, cough).
- Positive apnea test (PaCO2 >60 mm Hg or 20 mm Hg increase over baseline without respiratory movements).
- Ancillary tests (if needed): cerebral angiography, transcranial ultrasound, CT/MR angiography, radionuclide brain imaging, somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs).

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Vegetative state
- Minimally responsive state
- Locked-in syndrome
- Hypothermia
- Drug intoxication
- Guillain-Barre syndrome
- Delayed paralytic clearance

**Treatment Options**
- Withdrawal of cardiopulmonary support or organ harvest after legal death declaration.

**Critical Considerations**
- Strict adherence to AAN guidelines and protocols to avoid misdiagnosis.
- Apnea testing increases ICP and may precipitate cerebral herniation.
- Ancillary tests may be required if apnea testing is inconclusive or patient instability precludes it.

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Common causes: cardiopulmonary arrest, TBI, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage.
- Pathophysiology: inadequate cerebral perfusion and oxygenation leading to edema, increased ICP, herniation, and aseptic necrosis of brain tissue.
- Mortality rate: 100% upon brain death diagnosis.
