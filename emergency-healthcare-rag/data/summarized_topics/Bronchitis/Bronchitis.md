# Bronchitis

**Definition/Overview**
- Acute bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchi in the lower respiratory tract, often viral in origin, presenting with a persistent cough and without evidence of pneumonia.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Persistent cough, with or without sputum production
- Malaise
- Breathing difficulties
- Wheezing
- Low-grade fever (high-grade fevers are unusual)
- Chest wall or substernal pain due to prolonged coughing

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Clinical diagnosis based on history and physical examination
- Chest x-ray (CXR) may be used to exclude pneumonia (infiltrates)
- Oxygen saturation, pulse rate, temperature, and respiratory rate assessment
- Multiplex PCR testing for specific bacterial pathogens (_Bordetella pertussis_, _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_, _Chlamydia pneumoniae_)
- Procalcitonin levels to guide antibiotic therapy
- Spirometry may show transient bronchial hyperresponsiveness and reversibility of FEV1 >15%

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Asthma
- Acute or chronic sinusitis
- Bronchiolitis
- COPD
- GERD
- Viral pharyngitis
- Heart failure
- Pulmonary embolism
- Pneumonia

**Treatment Options**
- Symptomatic and supportive therapy
- Nonpharmacological: hot tea, honey, ginger, throat lozenges
- Antitussive agents: dextromethorphan (avoid codeine)
- Beta-agonists for wheezing (limited evidence)
- Analgesic and antipyretic agents for malaise, myalgia, and fever
- Short-term steroids for inflammation, especially in COPD or asthma
- Antibiotics not recommended for uncomplicated cases; reserved for confirmed bacterial infections (e.g., pertussis)
- Antiviral treatment for influenza

**Critical Considerations**
- Avoid unnecessary antibiotics due to resistance and side effects
- Consider complications such as secondary pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome
- Vaccination against influenza and pneumococcal disease in at-risk populations

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Affects ~5% of adults annually in the U.S.
- Viral infections (90-95% of cases), particularly in winter; less commonly bacterial
- Pathophysiology involves bronchial inflammation, mucosal thickening, and increased mucus production
- Risk factors: smoking, pollution, crowded living conditions, asthma

**Rare Presentations**
- Prolonged symptoms beyond 4 weeks
- Spontaneous pneumothorax
- Spontaneous pneumomediastinum
