# Bronchoscopy with BAL

**Definition/Overview**
Bronchoscopy is a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure that allows direct visualization of the airways, introduced clinically in 1966. It is essential in managing lung diseases and can be performed using flexible or rigid bronchoscopes.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Hemoptysis
- Chronic unexplained cough
- Stridor
- Mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Visualization of airways from the oral/nasal cavity to sub-segmental bronchi
- Endobronchial ultrasound for mediastinal structures and lung periphery
- Tissue sampling with biopsy forceps, aspiration needle, bronchial brush

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Cystic fibrosis
- Smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis
- Atelectasis in mechanically ventilated patients
- Fibrosing mediastinitis
- Pleural effusion
- Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
- Stage 1 Sarcoidosis
- Congestive lymphadenopathy
- Calcified lymphadenopathy
- Lymphoma
- COPD exacerbation with lymphadenopathy

**Treatment Options**
- Foreign body retrieval
- Tracheal and bronchial stent placement
- Balloon dilatation of airway stenosis
- Ablation/debulking of endobronchial tumors
- Management of persistent air leak or bronchopleural fistula
- Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction surgery
- Bronchial thermoplasty for asthma
- Whole lung lavage
- Adjunct during percutaneous tracheotomy

**Critical Considerations**
- Contraindications: severe hypoxia, hemodynamic instability, recent myocardial infarction, bleeding disorders, uncooperative patient
- Medication-related complications: CNS toxicity, methemoglobinemia, hemodynamic effects
- Procedure-related complications: bleeding, pneumothorax, cardiac arrhythmias, vocal cord trauma, pneumomediastinum, hypoxia

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
Bronchoscopy is widely used in the diagnosis and management of various airway and lung diseases. Technological advances have expanded its role as a minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic tool.
