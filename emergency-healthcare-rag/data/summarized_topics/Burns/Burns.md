# Burns

**Definition/Overview**
- Burns are injuries to tissues caused by heat, radiation, electricity, chemicals, or friction, with varying degrees of severity.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Pain
- Redness
- Swelling
- Blistering
- Charred skin
- Shock (in severe cases)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Superficial (first-degree): Epidermal damage only
- Partial Thickness (second-degree): Damage to epidermis and dermis
- Full Thickness (third-degree): Damage through dermis, affecting deeper tissues
- Fourth-degree: Damage to muscle and bone

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Chemical injury
- Frostbite
- Stevens-Johnson syndrome
- Toxic epidermal necrolysis

**Treatment Options**
- Fluid resuscitation (Parkland formula: 4 mL x kg x % TBSA burned)
- Pain management (analgesics, opioids)
- Wound care (debridement, topical antimicrobials)
- Surgical intervention (skin grafts, escharotomy)
- Supportive care (nutrition, physical therapy)
- Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) for certain cases

**Critical Considerations**
- Inhalation injury management
- Airway protection and respiratory support
- Circulatory support and monitoring for sepsis
- Prevention and treatment of burn wound infections
- Thermoregulation and prevention of hypothermia
- Neuromuscular blockade considerations (avoid succinylcholine in hyperkalemic risk)

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Approximately 2 million burn injuries annually in the U.S.
- Pathophysiology involves a complex inflammatory response, capillary permeability changes, and hypermetabolic state.
- Rare presentations include electrical burns and burns with unusual patterns or from uncommon sources.

**Terminology**
- TBSA: Total Body Surface Area
- ARDS: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome
- ATA: Atmospheres Absolute (pressure unit for HBO)
