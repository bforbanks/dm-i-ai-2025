# C-Reactive Protein (CRP)

**Definition/Overview**
- C-reactive protein (CRP) is a pentameric acute-phase reactant synthesized by the liver in response to inflammation, with two primary isoforms: pentameric (pCRP) and monomeric (mCRP).

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Not applicable (CRP is a laboratory marker, not a clinical symptom or sign).

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- CRP levels:
  - <0.3 mg/dL: Normal
  - 0.3 to 1.0 mg/dL: Minor elevation
  - 1.0 to 10.0 mg/dL: Moderate elevation
  - >10.0 mg/dL: Marked elevation
  - >50.0 mg/dL: Severe elevation
- hsCRP levels for cardiovascular risk:
  - <1 mg/dL: Low risk
  - 1-3 mg/dL: Moderate risk
  - >3 mg/dL: High risk

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Infections (bacterial, viral)
- Inflammatory disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, SLE)
- Tissue injury
- Cardiovascular disease
- Malignancies
- Venous thromboembolism
- Obesity

**Treatment Options**
- Not applicable (CRP is a diagnostic marker, not a treatable condition).

**Critical Considerations**
- CRP levels rise rapidly in response to inflammatory stimuli and decline once the trigger resolves.
- Chronic elevation may indicate ongoing inflammation.
- Interpretation must consider factors like age, sex, comorbidities, and medications.

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- CRP is involved in pathogen recognition, complement activation, and phagocytosis.
- Elevated CRP levels are associated with increased cardiovascular and cancer risk.
- Genetic polymorphisms can influence baseline CRP levels.
- Higher levels of hsCRP correlate with increased risk of frailty progression.
