# COPD Exacerbation

**Definition/Overview**
- COPD is a progressive inflammatory lung disease characterized by airflow limitation and tissue destruction, often due to prolonged exposure to noxious particles or gases, primarily cigarette smoke.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Chronic and progressive dyspnea
- Cough
- Sputum production
- Wheezing
- Chest tightness
- Accessory respiratory muscle use
- Prolonged expiration
- Increased anterior-posterior chest wall diameter (barrel chest)
- Central cyanosis (in cases of low arterial oxygenation)
- Digital clubbing
- Lower extremity edema in right heart failure

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Spirometry confirming FEV1/FVC ratio < 0.7 post-bronchodilator
- Severity assessed by FEV1, symptom severity (mMRC or CAT), and exacerbation history
- GOLD classification 1-4 for severity, and GOLD group A-D for symptom/exacerbation risk
- Chest X-ray and CT may show hyperinflation, diaphragm flattening, and emphysematous changes
- Laboratory tests for alpha-1 antitrypsin levels, complete blood count

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Asthma
- Asthma-COPD overlap syndrome
- Interstitial lung disease
- Bronchiolitis obliterans
- Diffuse panbronchiolitis
- Heart failure
- Thromboembolic disease
- Lymphangioleiomyomatosis
- Tuberculosis
- Cystic fibrosis
- Bronchiectasis
- Malignancy

**Treatment Options**
- Smoking cessation
- Bronchodilators (SABA, LABA, SAMA, LAMA)
- Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)
- Systemic glucocorticoids for acute exacerbations
- Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitors
- Antibiotics for bacterial exacerbations
- Vaccinations (influenza, pneumococcal)
- Pulmonary rehabilitation
- Oxygen therapy
- Surgical interventions (bullectomy, lung volume reduction surgery, lung transplantation) in severe cases

**Critical Considerations**
- Monitor for acute exacerbations, respiratory failure, and comorbidities like pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale
- Use BODE index for mortality risk assessment
- Manage comorbidities and complications
- Educate on proper inhaler technique and adherence to treatment

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Prevalence increases with age, primarily in smokers and those over 40
- Pathophysiology involves oxidative stress, protease-antiprotease imbalance, and chronic inflammation leading to airway narrowing and decreased lung recoil
- Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a rare genetic cause, typically affecting the lower lobes
