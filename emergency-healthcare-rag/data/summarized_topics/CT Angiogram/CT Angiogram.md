# CT Angiogram

**Definition/Overview**
Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) is a non-invasive imaging modality that uses CT technology and intravenous contrast material to visualize vascular anatomy and pathology, including the cardiac chambers and vascular system.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Not applicable for imaging modality

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Triple-phase CT acquisition after intravenous contrast administration
- High-resolution CT data with two or three-dimensional angiographic reconstruction
- Visualization of vascular lumen and wall, and assessment of blood flow

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Not applicable for imaging modality

**Treatment Options**
- Not a treatment modality, but used for diagnosis and to guide therapeutic interventions

**Critical Considerations**
- Requires consideration of contrast medium-induced nephrotoxicity and allergic reactions
- Use of minimal contrast volume and adequate peri-procedural hydration
- Calculation of maximal acceptable contrast dose (MACD) and contrast volume to creatinine clearance (CCC) ratio to minimize risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN)

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- CTA has largely replaced invasive angiography for diagnostic purposes
- Provides functional assessment of vascular lesions
- Limited in assessing blood flow to extremities due to small vessel diameter
- Inherent limitations in identifying arterial calcification compared to intravascular ultrasound

**Contraindications**
- Absolute: Morbid obesity beyond weight limit of angiography table (350 pounds)
- Relative: Pregnancy, severe iodinated contrast allergy, renal impairment, coagulopathy (INR > 2, platelets < 50,000/microliter), diabetes on metformin, excessive anxiety or inability to lie still

**Equipment**
- CT scanner with high-resolution capabilities
- Intravenous contrast material
- Peripheral venous access for contrast administration

**Personnel**
- Led by clinicians specialized in interventional radiology, vascular surgery, interventional neuroradiology, or interventional cardiology
- Support from angiography lab nurses, nurse managers, and radiology technicians with skills in vascular imaging and cardiovascular monitoring

**Preparation**
- Individualized based on patient characteristics and type of angiography
- Hydration to minimize nephrotoxicity risk
- Fasting for 6-8 hours as required
- Evaluation of renal function, medication review, and allergy history

**Technique or Treatment**
- Access gained via large or medium-sized artery (commonly femoral or radial)
- Use of catheters, guide wires, and contrast medium to visualize vasculature
- Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) technique for image acquisition

**Complications**
- Minor: Bruising, nausea, pain, minor allergic reactions, transient renal function deterioration, hot flushes
- Major: Significant bleeding, hematoma, false aneurysm, anaphylactoid reaction, acute renal failure
- Preventive measures for contrast-related complications include adequate hydration and minimal contrast use

**Clinical Significance**
- CTA and MRA have replaced invasive angiography for most diagnostic uses
- Can provide functional assessment of vascular lesions
- Diagnostic accuracy of CT-FFR compared with invasive FFR is 81.9%, but lower for values between 0.70 and 0.80
- Conventional invasive angiography remains critical for therapeutic percutaneous interventions
