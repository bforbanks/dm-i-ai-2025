# CT Other

**Definition/Overview**
- Computed Tomography (CT) is a radiological imaging study that produces cross-sectional images using X-rays and computer processing, providing detailed information about body structures.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Not applicable (diagnostic imaging modality).

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- CT scans are interpreted based on the Hounsfield scale, with specific densities corresponding to different tissues and pathologies.
- Use of intravenous or oral contrast agents to enhance image detail and differentiate between tissues.

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Differential diagnoses vary widely depending on the body part being imaged and the clinical context.

**Treatment Options**
- Not applicable (diagnostic imaging modality).

**Critical Considerations**
- Radiation exposure: CT scans involve ionizing radiation, with potential risks that must be balanced against diagnostic benefits.
- Contrast agents: Potential for allergic reactions and nephrotoxicity, especially in patients with preexisting kidney disease.
- Artifacts: Metal objects can cause streak artifacts, obscuring images and complicating interpretation.

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- CT scans are widely used in various clinical settings, from emergency medicine to cancer screening and intraoperative guidance.
- The technology has evolved from axial to spiral/helical CT, reducing scan time and radiation dose.
- CT scans have a higher sensitivity for certain conditions compared to traditional X-rays, such as detecting subtle fractures or characterizing lung pathology.

**Surgical Considerations**
- CT scans can guide biopsies, abscess drainages, and surgical planning.
- Intraoperative CT can assist in real-time during surgical procedures, ensuring accurate intervention.

**Clinical Significance**
- CT scans are critical in diagnosing and managing a wide range of conditions, including trauma, cancer, infectious diseases, and vascular disorders.
- They are particularly valuable in emergency settings for rapid assessment of injuries and acute pathologies.
- CT scans have also become important in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic for assessing lung involvement.
