# Cardiac Arrest

**Definition/Overview**
Cardiac arrest is the abrupt loss of heart function, leading to the absence of responsiveness, normal breathing, and circulation, potentially progressing to sudden death if not promptly treated with interventions such as CPR, defibrillation, cardioversion, or pacing.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Unresponsiveness
- Absence of normal breathing
- Lack of palpable central pulse

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Clinical diagnosis based on the absence of responsiveness, normal breathing, and circulation
- Point-of-care testing may include potassium and glucose levels
- Point-of-care ultrasound may be used to assess for cardiac activity

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Syncope: transient loss of consciousness with normal breathing and pulse upon recovery
- Seizure: unresponsiveness with abnormal rhythmic activity and presence of pulse
- Opiate overdose: unresponsiveness, abnormal breathing, but presence of pulse

**Treatment Options**
- **Lay Rescuer:** Hands-only CPR, AED use, rescue breaths for drowning victims
- **Basic Life Support (BLS):** 30:2 compressions-to-breaths ratio, airway maneuvers (head-tilt, chin-lift, jaw thrust), OPA/NPA use
- **Advanced Life Support (ALS):** BLS measures plus medications (Epinephrine, Amiodarone), advanced airways, defibrillation
- **Medical Management:** ALS measures plus potential ECMO
- **Trauma Management:** Needle decompression, resuscitative thoracotomy, REBOA for hemorrhage control

**Critical Considerations**
- Early CPR and defibrillation are crucial for survival
- AED failure and complications in IV/IO access can occur
- Post-ROSC care includes targeted temperature management and airway maintenance

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Ischemic coronary disease is the leading cause of cardiac arrest
- Incidence peaks from birth to 6 months (SIDS) and between ages 45 to 75
- Structural cardiac diseases and non-cardiac etiologies like pulmonary embolism, sepsis, and trauma are common causes

**Consultations**
- Trauma surgery for traumatic etiologies
- Intensive care team for post-ROSC management
- Cardiology for primary cardiac etiologies

**Deterrence and Patient Education**
- Importance of layperson CPR training and AED use
- Overcoming hesitancy to perform CPR due to various factors
