# Cardiac Catheterization

**Definition/Overview**
Cardiac catheterization is an invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedure performed to evaluate and treat cardiovascular conditions, with over 1,000,000 procedures annually in the U.S.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Not applicable (procedure-based topic)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Not applicable (procedure-based topic)

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Not applicable (procedure-based topic)

**Treatment Options**
- **Diagnostic Procedures**: Evaluation of coronary artery disease, hemodynamics, ventricular function, arrhythmias, valvular heart disease, pericardial/myocardial diseases, congenital heart diseases, heart failure.
- **Therapeutic Procedures**: Interventions for coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, valvular heart disease, etc.
- **Access Sites**: Common femoral artery, radial artery, ulnar artery, brachial artery.
- **Techniques**: Fluoroscopy-guided, ultrasound-guided, Allen or Barbeau test for radial access, transradial or transfemoral approaches.

**Critical Considerations**
- **Complications**: Hematoma, retroperitoneal bleeding, pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, dissection, thrombosis, embolism, radial artery occlusion, allergic reactions, acute renal failure, infection, radiation injury, arrhythmias.
- **Mortality Risk**: <0.05% for diagnostic procedures.
- **Stroke Risk**: 0.05% to 0.1% for diagnostic, up to 0.4% for interventions.
- **Prevention**: Appropriate access site selection, minimizing catheter exchanges, pre-hydration, use of iso-osmolar contrast agents.

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- **Prevalence**: Over 1,000,000 procedures annually in the U.S.
- **Mechanisms**: Invasive access to cardiovascular system for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.
- **Rare Variants**: Uncommon access sites, atypical complications (e.g., radial artery perforation, atheroembolism).
