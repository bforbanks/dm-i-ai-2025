# Cardiac Contusion

**Definition/Overview**
- Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the pericardium, leading to heart compression, restricted cardiac chamber filling, hypotension, and potential cardiac arrest.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Sudden onset chest pain, pleuritic in nature, improves when leaning forward, worsens when lying down
- Hypotension, jugular venous distension, muffled heart sounds (Beckâ€™s triad)
- Pulses paradoxus (systolic blood pressure decrease >10 mm Hg with inspiration)
- Altered mental status, dizziness, syncope in severe cases
- Friedrich sign (steep X and Y descents in jugular vein waveform)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- ECG changes in pericarditis: diffuse concave up ST-segment elevation (stage I), normalization of ST and PR segments (stage II), T-wave inversions (stage III), T-wave normalization (stage IV)
- Laboratory: leukocytosis, elevated renal function tests, increased sedimentation rate, and CRP
- Echocardiogram: right ventricular collapse, bowing of the intraventricular septum
- CT or cardiovascular MRI for myocarditis evaluation

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, Type A aortic dissection, tension pneumothorax
- Acute coronary syndrome, angina, peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, esophagitis

**Treatment Options**
- Pericarditis: High-dose NSAIDs with/without colchicine, high-dose aspirin for Dressler syndrome, corticosteroids not first-line, immunosuppressive agents for recurrent cases
- Cardiac tamponade: Pericardiocentesis (blindly or with ultrasonography/fluoroscopy guidance), surgical drainage if necessary, pericardial window for prevention

**Critical Considerations**
- Rapid identification and treatment of cardiac tamponade are crucial to prevent hemodynamic collapse
- Clinical signs are neither sensitive nor specific; imaging and ECG are critical for diagnosis
- Management of underlying etiology is essential in pericarditis treatment

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Pericarditis: 0.1%-0.2% of hospitalized patients for non-ischemic chest pain, idiopathic in 90% of cases
- Cardiac tamponade: More common in HIV-positive patients, end-stage renal disease, malignancies, tuberculosis, autoimmune diseases
- Pathophysiology: Inflammation or fluid accumulation leads to compression of cardiac chambers, decreased venous return, and cardiac output
