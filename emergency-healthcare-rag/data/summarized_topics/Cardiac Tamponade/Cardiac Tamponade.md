# Cardiac Tamponade

**Definition/Overview**
Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening condition characterized by the accumulation of excessive fluid in the pericardium, leading to heart compression, restricted cardiac chamber filling, hypotension, and potential cardiac arrest.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Sudden onset chest pain, pleuritic in nature, improves when leaning forward
- Hypotension
- Jugular venous distension
- Muffled heart sounds
- Pulsus paradoxus (systolic blood pressure decrease >10 mm Hg with inspiration)
- Dyspnea, palpitations, dizziness, syncope, altered mental status in severe cases
- Pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- ECG changes in pericarditis: diffuse concave up ST-segment elevation (Stage I), normalization of ST and PR segments (Stage II), T-wave inversions (Stage III), T-wave normalization (Stage IV)
- Echocardiogram findings: right ventricular collapse, bowing of the intraventricular septum
- Laboratory: leukocytosis, elevated renal function tests, elevated sedimentation rate, and CRP
- Imaging: CT or cardiovascular MRI if myocarditis is suspected

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Pulmonary embolism
- Myocardial infarction
- Type A aortic dissection
- Tension pneumothorax
- Acute coronary syndrome
- Angina
- Peptic ulcer disease
- Gastritis or esophagitis

**Treatment Options**
- Pericarditis: High-dose NSAIDs, colchicine, high-dose aspirin (ASA) for Dressler syndrome, corticosteroids (not first-line), steroid-sparing agents (azathioprine, IVIG)
- Cardiac tamponade: Pericardiocentesis (blindly or with ultrasonography/fluoroscopy guidance), surgical drainage for clotted hemopericardium or ineffective needle drainage, pericardial window for recurrence prevention

**Critical Considerations**
- Rapid identification and treatment are crucial to prevent progression to cardiac arrest
- Clinical signs are neither sensitive nor specific; imaging is essential for diagnosis
- Monitor for ECG progression and complications such as constrictive pericarditis

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Pericarditis: 0.1% to 0.2% of hospitalized patients for non-ischemic chest pain
- Cardiac tamponade: More common in HIV-positive patients, end-stage renal disease, malignancies, tuberculosis, autoimmune diseases
- Pathophysiology: Inflammation or fluid accumulation in the pericardium, leading to decreased venous return, ventricular filling, and cardiac output
