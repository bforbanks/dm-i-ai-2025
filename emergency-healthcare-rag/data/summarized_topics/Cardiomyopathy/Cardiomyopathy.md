# Cardiomyopathy

**Definition/Overview**
- Cardiomyopathy refers to diseases of the heart muscle that affect cardiac function, including Alcoholic Cardiomyopathy (ACM), Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM), and Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM).

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- **ACM**: Dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, syncopal episodes, cachexia, muscular atrophy, peripheral edema, hepatomegaly, jugular venous distention, S3 gallop, mitral regurgitation murmur.
- **DCM**: Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, leg swelling, fatigue, malaise, weakness, thromboembolic complications, arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, displaced PMI, tricuspid/mitral regurgitation murmurs, jugular venous distension.
- **HCM**: Severe dyspnea, chest pain, presyncope, syncope during exertion, dynamic LVOT obstruction.

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- **ACM**: Dilated cardiomyopathy on 2D echocardiography, LV end-diastolic dimension >2 SD above normal, LVEF <50%, exclusion of hypertensive, valvular, and ischemic heart diseases.
- **DCM**: LV enlargement and dilation, LVEF <40%, systolic dysfunction, exclusion of secondary causes.
- **HCM**: Maximal end-diastolic wall thickness ≥1.5 cm or 1.3 to 1.4 cm with a positive family history/genetic test, absence of other conditions, significant LVOT gradient ≥30 mm Hg.

**Differential Diagnosis**
- **ACM**: Constrictive cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, cirrhotic cardiomyopathy, Takatsubo cardiomyopathy, drug-induced cardiomyopathy, beriberi.
- **DCM**: Cardiac tamponade, acute pericarditis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy.
- **HCM**: Other causes of LV hypertrophy such as hypertension, aortic stenosis, amyloidosis, glycogen storage diseases, lysosomal storage diseases.

**Treatment Options**
- **ACM**: Abstinence from alcohol, heart failure therapy (beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, diuretics, aldosterone receptor antagonists, angiotensin blocker-neprilysin inhibitor), carvedilol, trimetazidine.
- **DCM**: Intravenous loop diuretics for acute exacerbation, oral diuretics, ACE inhibitors/ARBs, aldosterone receptor antagonists, beta-blockers, isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine, anticoagulation, cardiac transplantation, LVAD, ICD, CRT.
- **HCM**: Beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, disopyramide, septal reduction therapy (surgical myomectomy or alcohol septal ablation).

**Critical Considerations**
- **ACM**: ECG progression, complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, cardioembolic phenomenon, mortality rates.
- **DCM**: Progressive nature leading to heart failure, conduction system abnormalities, ventricular arrhythmias, thromboembolism.
- **HCM**: Dynamic LVOT obstruction, arrhythmias, diastolic dysfunction, ischemia, autonomic dysfunction, procedural complications of septal reduction therapy.

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- **ACM**: Chronic alcohol consumption, ventricular dilation, increased LV mass, heart failure, oxidative stress injury, mitochondrial damage, apoptosis, alteration of calcium homeostasis.
- **DCM**: Idiopathic or secondary to myocardial insults, ventricular enlargement, systolic and diastolic dysfunction, myocardial remodeling, neurohumoral activation.
- **HCM**: Inherited condition, septal hypertrophy, abnormal mitral valve morphology, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, diastolic heart failure, ischemic symptoms.
