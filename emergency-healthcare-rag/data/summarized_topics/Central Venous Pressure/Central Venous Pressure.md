# Central Venous Pressure

**Definition/Overview**
Central venous pressure (CVP) is the pressure within the vena cava, reflecting preload and right atrial pressure, and is used to assess hemodynamic status.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Elevated CVP: Jugular venous distension, pulsation at 45 degrees inclination
- Low CVP: Signs of hypovolemia (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Normal CVP: 8 to 12 mmHg
- Measurement: Via central venous catheter in superior vena cava near right atrium
- Ultrasound assessment: Maximal inferior vena cava diameter, inspiratory collapse, internal jugular aspect ratio
- Elevated CVP: IVC diameter >2 cm
- Low CVP: IVC diameter <2 cm

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Elevated CVP: Heart failure, valve abnormalities, dysrhythmias, positive end-expiratory pressure, pulmonary arterial resistance, tension pneumothorax, pericardial tamponade, right ventricular infarct, right ventricular outflow obstruction
- Low CVP: Hypovolemia, venodilation

**Treatment Options**
- Elevated CVP: Address underlying cause (e.g., diuretics for fluid overload, pericardiocentesis for tamponade)
- Low CVP: Fluid resuscitation for hypovolemia, vasopressors for venodilation

**Critical Considerations**
- CVP is a poor predictor of fluid responsiveness
- CVP should not be solely used to guide fluid resuscitation
- Consideration of dynamic parameters (e.g., lactate clearance, IVC collapsibility index, TAPSE)

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- CVP influenced by blood volume, venous compliance, cardiac output, orthostasis, arterial dilation, preload
- Starling's law and Guyton's law describe the relationship between CVP, venous return, and cardiac output
- CVP is inversely related to venous return and affected by intrathoracic pressure
- Peripheral venous pressure affected by volume changes and venous tone (sympathetic nervous system, external compression)
