# Cervical Spine Injury

**Definition/Overview**
Cervical spine injury in geriatric patients is a common trauma-related condition with high morbidity and mortality, often resulting from low-energy mechanisms such as falls.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- History of trauma, possibly minor or unreported
- Cognitive decline or incomplete history
- Potential underlying medical causes for trauma (e.g., arrhythmia, stroke)
- Physical exam findings may include neurological deficits, signs of other injuries

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- **CT scan**: Preferred imaging modality due to limitations of plain radiographs in visualizing C1 and C2 and the presence of osteopenia/osteoarthritis
- **Canadian C-spine Rule**: Recommends imaging for any patient aged 65 or older with a GCS of 15
- **NEXUS criteria**: Absence of focal neurologic deficit, intoxication, midline neck tenderness, distracting injury, and normal alertness or baseline mental status

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Acute torticollis
- Cauda equina and conus medullaris syndrome
- Cervical strain
- Hanging injuries and strangulation
- Neck trauma
- Septic shock
- Spinal cord infections
- Spinal cord injuries
- Spinal cord neoplasms
- Thoracic outlet syndrome
- Vertebral artery dissection

**Treatment Options**
- Rigid collar immobilization without reduction
- Halo cast immobilization with reduction
- Surgical management
- Multidisciplinary team approach including trauma surgery, orthopedics, physical therapy, and medical doctors

**Critical Considerations**
- High index of suspicion for occult trauma
- Consideration of other medical reasons for trauma
- Thorough neurologic exam
- Low threshold for imaging due to double the risk of cervical spine injury compared to younger patients
- If cervical spine fracture is diagnosed, image the entire spine

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- One-third of geriatric patients sustain falls annually
- Bimodal peak incidence of cervical fractures at ages 15-54 and 65-80
- Prevalence rate of 2.6% to 4.7% in patients over 65
- Cervical spine composed of an anterior column (vertebral bodies, discs, ligaments) and a posterior column (pedicles, laminae, facets, ligaments)
- Increased mobility in C1-C2 in the elderly, making it more prone to injury
- Pre-existing conditions like ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and cervical canal stenosis increase the risk of injury
