# Chest Pain (non-cardiac)

**Definition/Overview**
- Chest pain not related to cardiac causes is a symptom with a broad differential diagnosis, including life-threatening and benign etiologies. It requires careful evaluation to exclude serious conditions.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Dull, deep, pressure-like, or squeezing visceral pain
- Sharp, stabbing, or poking somatic pain
- Pain referral to shoulders, jaw, or arm
- Associated symptoms: nausea, vomiting, fever, diaphoresis, cough, dyspepsia, edema, calf pain/swelling
- Risk factors: history of MI, family cardiac history, smoking, HTN, HLD, diabetes, DVT/PE, recent surgery, cancer, non-ambulation, GI procedures, drug abuse

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- ECG within first 10 minutes, serial ECGs
- Chest x-ray
- CBC, BMP, serial troponin levels, lipase
- CTPA or VQ scan for suspected PE
- Bedside US for pericardial tamponade

**Differential Diagnosis**
- ACS
- Aortic dissection
- PE
- PTX
- Pericardial tamponade
- Esophageal perforation
- GERD
- Musculoskeletal causes
- Pneumonia/pleuritis
- Herpes zoster
- Pericarditis
- Cervical radiculopathy
- Esophageal spasm

**Treatment Options**
- ACS: Cardiac monitor, IV access, aspirin, clopidogrel/ticagrelor, pain control, O2 therapy, nitroglycerin, reperfusion (PCI or thrombolytics)
- PE: Thrombolytics for unstable patients, anticoagulants for stable patients
- PTX: Chest tube decompression
- Pericardial tamponade: Fluid bolus, needle pericardiocentesis, or pericardial window
- Aortic dissection: Immediate surgery, beta-blockers, blood pressure control
- Esophageal perforation: Surgical consult, contrast esophagram
- GERD: GI cocktail (viscous lidocaine with Maalox), PPI or H2 blocker therapy

**Critical Considerations**
- Serial ECGs and troponin levels for ACS
- Hemodynamic stability assessment for PE and PTX
- Urgency of surgical intervention for aortic dissection and esophageal perforation
- Importance of ruling out ACS before diagnosing GERD

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Chest pain accounts for ~5% of emergency department visits
- Visceral pain often has vague distribution and can refer to other locations
- Somatic pain is more localized and less likely to refer
- Prevalence of life-threatening causes: ACS (31%), PE (2%), aortic dissection (1%), others unreported
- Common non-cardiac causes: GERD (30%), musculoskeletal (28%), pneumonia/pleuritis (2%), herpes zoster (0.5%)
