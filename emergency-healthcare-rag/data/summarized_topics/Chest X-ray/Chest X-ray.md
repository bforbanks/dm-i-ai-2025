# Chest X-ray

**Definition/Overview**
Chest X-ray, or chest radiography, is a common initial imaging modality for evaluating the mediastinum and thoracic cavity, aiding in the diagnosis of various emergent and non-emergent conditions.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Mediastinal widening (>8 cm on PA chest radiograph)
- Abnormal hilum overlay sign
- Thickened right paratracheal stripe (>4 mm)
- Abnormal aorticopulmonary window contour
- Obscured paraspinal lines

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- PA and lateral chest X-ray views for outpatient evaluation
- Portable AP X-ray for ICU patients or those unable to tolerate PA views
- Signs of aortic dissection, pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum, pneumothorax, infections, or masses
- Fluoroscopy for diaphragmatic paralysis and barium swallow for esophageal diseases

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Aortic dissection
- Mediastinal hematoma
- Aortic aneurysm
- Mediastinal tumors
- Neurogenic tumors
- Extramedullary hematopoiesis

**Treatment Options**
- Treatment is condition-specific and not directly related to the imaging modality itself.
- Imaging findings guide the management of underlying conditions.

**Critical Considerations**
- Mediastinal widening in trauma patients suggests aortic dissection or hematoma.
- Hilum overlay sign helps localize mediastinal masses.
- Chest fluoroscopy is used for real-time imaging of diaphragmatic movement.
- CT is preferred for detailed evaluation of mediastinal pathology, with MRI as an alternative when CT is contraindicated.

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Mediastinal masses are categorized by their location in anterior, middle, or posterior compartments.
- Anterior mediastinal masses include thymic tumors, lymphoma, thyroid tumors, and teratomas.
- Middle mediastinal masses include lymphoma, metastatic lymphadenopathy, and aneurysms.
- Posterior mediastinal masses include neurogenic tumors, bony metastasis, and paravertebral abscess.
- Pneumomediastinum can be spontaneous or secondary to trauma, asthma, COPD, or iatrogenic causes.
- Aortic dissection and pulmonary embolism are critical conditions evaluated by CT angiography.
