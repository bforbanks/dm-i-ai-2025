# Coagulation Studies (PT_PTT_INR)

**Definition/Overview**
- Coagulation studies assess the coagulation status of an individual, crucial for diagnosing bleeding or thrombotic disorders.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Bleeding from multiple sites
- Hematuria, oliguria, anuria
- Dyspnea, hemoptysis
- Mental status changes
- Chest pain
- Skin lesions: ecchymosis, hematomas, jaundice, necrosis, gangrene
- Purpura, petechiae, cyanosis

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- **Prothrombin Time (PT):** Normal 9-13 seconds; prolonged in liver disease, vitamin K deficiency, anticoagulant use.
- **Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT):** Normal 25-35 seconds; prolonged in intrinsic pathway factor deficiencies, hemophilia, heparin therapy.
- **Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT):** Similar to PTT, with activator added; more specific for certain conditions.
- **International Normalized Ratio (INR):** Normal 0.8-1.2; used to monitor warfarin therapy, higher values indicate increased bleeding risk.
- **Anti-Factor Xa:** Monitors low molecular weight heparin, especially in special populations.
- **D-Dimer:** Normal <500 ng/mL; elevated in DVT, PE, DIC, inflammation, infection, surgery, pregnancy.

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Dysfibrinogenemia
- Hemolytic uremic syndrome
- Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
- Immune thrombocytopenia
- Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura

**Treatment Options**
- Address underlying disorder (antibiotics for sepsis, delivery for placental abruption)
- Platelet transfusions if <50 x 10^9/L (active bleeding) or 10-20 x 10^9/L (high risk)
- Fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate to replenish factors
- Prothrombin complex concentrate (mild correction)
- Heparin to prevent further clotting
- Prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin or low molecular weight heparin if not actively bleeding

**Critical Considerations**
- Regular monitoring of coagulation studies is essential for patients on anticoagulant therapy.
- INR must be maintained within target range to balance bleeding and clotting risks.
- Anti-factor Xa levels should be checked 3-5 hours after the third dose of low molecular weight heparin.

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- DIC occurs in 30-50% of severe sepsis cases, 1-5% of chronic diseases, and 15.5% post-surgery.
- Pathophysiology involves tissue factor release, activation of coagulation factor VII, thrombin and fibrin formation, and consumption of clotting factors and platelets.
