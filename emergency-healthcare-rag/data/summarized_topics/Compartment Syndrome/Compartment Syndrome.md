# Compartment Syndrome

**Definition/Overview**
- Acute Compartment Syndrome (ACS) is a surgical emergency characterized by increased pressure within a closed osteofascial compartment, leading to impaired circulation and potential ischemia and necrosis.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Severe pain, disproportionate to injury
- Pain with passive stretching of muscles
- Paresthesia, hypoesthesia
- Tense or "wood-like" compartment
- Pallor, paralysis, pulselessness (late findings)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Clinical diagnosis, supported by:
  - Intracompartmental pressure (ICP) > 30 mmHg
  - Delta pressure (diastolic blood pressure - ICP) ≤ 30 mmHg
  - Serial or continuous ICP monitoring recommended
  - Normal compartment pressure: < 10 mmHg

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Deep vein thrombosis
- Cellulitis
- Gas gangrene
- Phlegmasia cerulean dolens
- Rhabdomyolysis
- Cnidaria envenomation
- Peripheral vascular injuries

**Treatment Options**
- Immediate surgical consult
- Fasciotomy if ICP ≥ 30 mmHg or delta pressure ≤ 30 mmHg
- Remove restrictive dressings
- Extremity at heart level
- Supplemental oxygen and blood pressure support
- Serial ICP measurements for high-risk patients
- Skin graft post-fasciotomy if needed

**Critical Considerations**
- Rapid progression possible; serial exams crucial
- Fasciotomy ideally within 6 hours, not recommended after 36 hours
- Risk of infection and amputation if necrosis occurs pre-fasciotomy

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Incidence: 7.3 per 100,000 males, 0.7 per 100,000 females
- Common in males < 35 years, high-energy trauma victims
- Pathophysiology: Increased pressure impairs venous outflow and arterial inflow, leading to ischemia and potential necrosis
- Commonly associated with tibial fractures, soft tissue injuries, burns, vascular injuries, crush injuries, drug overdoses, reperfusion injuries, thrombosis, bleeding disorders, infections, and improper cast/splint application

**Abdominal Compartment Syndrome**
- Elevated intra-abdominal pressure > 20 mmHg causing end-organ damage
- Measured via intravesicular catheter pressures
- Treatment includes nonsurgical interventions to decrease intra-abdominal volume or surgical decompression via laparotomy
- Complications include renal failure, bowel ischemia, respiratory distress or failure, increased cranial pressure, cardiac failure, and potential death
