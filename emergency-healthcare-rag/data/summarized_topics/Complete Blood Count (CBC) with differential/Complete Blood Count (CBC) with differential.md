# Complete Blood Count (CBC) with differential

**Definition/Overview**
- A Complete Blood Count (CBC) with differential is a laboratory test that measures the size, quantity, and types of cells in the blood, including red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Symptoms and signs are not directly associated with CBC but may relate to underlying conditions that the CBC can help diagnose.

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- **Hemoglobin (Hb)**: Normal is 13-18 g/dL in men, 12-16 g/dL in women, and ≥10 g/dL in pregnancy.
- **Hematocrit (Hct)**: Normal is 40%-54% in men, 36%-48% in women.
- **RBC count**: Normal is 4.6-6.2 million cells/μL in men, 4.2-5.4 million cells/μL in women.
- **Red Cell Indices**: MCV (80-100 fL), MCH (27-32 pg/cell), MCHC (32-36 g/dL), RDW (11.5%-15%).
- **WBC count**: Normal is 4500-11000 cells/μL.
- **Neutrophil count**: Normal is 1500-8000 cells/µL or 40%-60% of WBC.
- **Lymphocyte count**: Normal is 1000-4000 cells/µL or 20%-40% of WBC.
- **Monocyte count**: Normal is 200-1000 cells/µL or 2%-8% of WBC.
- **Eosinophil count**: Normal is 0-500 cells/µL or 0%-4% of WBC.
- **Basophil count**: Normal is 0-200 cells/µL or 0.5%-1% of WBC.
- **Platelet count**: Normal is 150,000-400,000/μL.

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Anemia, erythrocytosis, leukopenia, leukocytosis, neutropenia, neutrophilia, lymphocytopenia, lymphocytosis, monocytopenia, monocytosis, eosinopenia, eosinophilia, basopenia, basophilia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis.

**Treatment Options**
- Treatment is condition-specific and not directly related to CBC results.

**Critical Considerations**
- Spurious results can occur due to factors like hypervolemia, dehydration, lipemia, hyperbilirubinemia, paraproteinemia, hyperleukocytosis, agglutination, and sample contamination.
- CBC results must be interpreted in clinical context and according to local laboratory reference intervals.
- Peripheral blood smear examination is recommended for abnormal CBC results.

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- CBC is a common test with variable reference ranges based on demographic factors.
- Pathophysiology of abnormal results can include blood loss, destruction, deficient production, or defective production of blood cells, as well as myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative diseases, infections, and hypersensitivity reactions.
