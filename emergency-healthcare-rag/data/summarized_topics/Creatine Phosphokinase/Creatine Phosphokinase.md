# Creatine Phosphokinase

**Definition/Overview**
- Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK), also known as Creatine Kinase (CK), is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of creatine and ATP to phosphocreatine (PCr) and ADP, playing a crucial role in cellular energy homeostasis.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Muscle pain, weakness
- Dark-colored urine (myoglobinuria)
- Symptoms of myocardial infarction (chest pain, shortness of breath, etc.)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Elevated serum CK levels indicative of muscle damage
- Isoenzymes: CPK-MB (cardiac muscle), CPK-MM (skeletal muscle), CPK-BB (brain)
- Electrophoresis mobility: BB > MB > MM
- CK-MB mass assays and ratio of CK-MB2 to CK-MB1 for AMI diagnosis
- CK levels >1000 IU/L suggest rhabdomyolysis; >5000 IU/L indicate severe rhabdomyolysis

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
- Rhabdomyolysis
- Muscular dystrophies
- Strenuous exercise
- Medication effects (e.g., statins)
- Connective tissue diseases
- Thyroid disorders

**Treatment Options**
- IV fluids for rhabdomyolysis to preserve kidney function
- Specific treatments for underlying conditions (e.g., AMI, muscular dystrophies)

**Critical Considerations**
- CK levels rise within 12 hours post-AMI, peak at 24-36 hours, normalize after 48-72 hours
- CK-MB more specific for myocardial damage but can increase in non-cardiac conditions
- Statins can significantly elevate CK levels, risk increased with CYP3A4 inhibitors
- Low CK levels associated with increased mortality in CKD, connective tissue diseases

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- CK found in tissues with high ATP demand: heart, skeletal muscles, brain
- Leakage into bloodstream upon muscular injury
- CK-MB used for AMI diagnosis, CK-MM for skeletal muscle damage
- Racial and sex differences in CK levels
- CK activity inversely related to thyroid activity
- Plasma CK activity associated with blood pressure, vascular contractility, renal sodium retention
