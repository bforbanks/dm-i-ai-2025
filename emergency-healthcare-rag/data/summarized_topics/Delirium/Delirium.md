# Delirium

**Definition/Overview**
Delirium is a clinical syndrome characterized by acute and fluctuating disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition, often accompanied by psychomotor behavioral changes and sleep-wake cycle disruptions.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Altered level of consciousness (e.g., hypervigilance, drowsiness, stupor)
- Impaired attention, inability to focus, sustain, or shift attention
- Disorganized thinking (memory, orientation, language issues)
- Psychomotor agitation or retardation
- Sleep disturbances
- Perceptual disturbances, hallucinations, delusions
- Emotional lability

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Acute onset and fluctuating course of symptoms
- Inattention and altered consciousness
- Additional cognitive disturbance
- Not explained by preexisting neurocognitive disorders
- Evidence of an underlying medical cause
- DSM-5 criteria met
- Tools: Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), CAM-ICU for ventilated patients

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Dementia
- Psychosis
- Depression
- Paranoia
- Coma
- Catatonia
- Central nervous system malignancy
- Nonconvulsive status epilepticus

**Treatment Options**
- Non-pharmacologic: sleep hygiene, sensory aids, orientation tools, mobilization, hydration, nutrition, bowel/bladder function monitoring, environmental optimization
- Pharmacologic (limited use): benzodiazepines for withdrawal, antipsychotics (haloperidol, quetiapine, risperidone) for severe agitation or risk of harm, antibiotics for infections
- Monitor QTc interval with ECG if antipsychotics used

**Critical Considerations**
- Monitor for complications: aspiration pneumonia, pressure ulcers, falls, malnutrition, fluid/electrolyte imbalances, long-term cognitive impairment, increased mortality
- Avoid anticholinergic and psychoactive medications
- Evaluate for untreated pain and sources of infection

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Higher prevalence in elderly, postoperative patients, and ICU admissions
- Multifactorial etiology: neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neurotransmitter imbalance, circadian rhythm disruption, neuroendocrine changes
- Predisposing factors: age >70, dementia, functional disabilities, sensory impairments
- Precipitating factors: medications, infections, surgery, metabolic disturbances, pain, environmental changes
- Persistent delirium in hospital settings: 45% until discharge, 33% one month later

**Deterrence and Patient Education**
- Early mobilization, sleep hygiene, sensory aid usage, pain management, hydration, nutrition, bowel/bladder function, early detection, environmental optimization, stress avoidance, clear communication, and timely specialist referral.
