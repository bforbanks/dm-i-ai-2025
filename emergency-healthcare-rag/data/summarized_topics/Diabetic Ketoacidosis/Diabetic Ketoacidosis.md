# Diabetic Ketoacidosis

**Definition/Overview**
- Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus characterized by hyperglycemia, acidosis, and ketonemia, primarily seen in type 1 diabetes but also occurring in type 2 diabetes.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia
- Dehydration: dry mouth, decreased sweating, decreased urine output
- Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss
- Kussmaul breathing (deep, labored breathing)
- Altered mental status, drowsiness, confusion
- Fruity-scented breath (acetone)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Blood glucose >250 mg/dL
- Arterial pH <7.3
- Serum bicarbonate <15 mEq/L
- Presence of ketonemia or ketonuria
- Anion gap >14-15 mEq/L

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS)
- Starvation ketosis
- Alcoholic ketoacidosis
- Lactic acidosis
- Sepsis
- Acute pancreatitis

**Treatment Options**
- Fluid resuscitation with isotonic saline, followed by 0.45% or 0.9% NaCl based on serum sodium levels
- Insulin therapy: IV infusion at 0.1 U/kg/hour, adjust based on glucose and anion gap
- Potassium replacement: start when K+ <5.2 mEq/L, target 4-5 mEq/L
- Avoid bicarbonate therapy unless pH <7.1
- Phosphate replacement generally not necessary unless severe hypophosphatemia
- Transition to subcutaneous insulin once DKA resolved and patient can eat

**Critical Considerations**
- Monitor for hypokalemia and hypoglycemia during treatment
- Cerebral edema: monitor mental status, treat with mannitol or hypertonic saline if suspected
- Avoid intubation if possible due to risks of worsening acidosis and aspiration

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Incidence: 0-56 per 1000 person-years, varies geographically
- Higher prevalence in type 1 diabetes, women, non-Whites
- Pathophysiology involves insulin deficiency, increased counter-regulatory hormones, lipolysis, and ketogenesis
- Euglycemic DKA can occur with SGLT2 inhibitors or in other specific scenarios

**Rare Presentations**
- Euglycemic DKA with blood glucose <250 mg/dL
- DKA precipitated by SGLT2 inhibitors, cocaine abuse, or other drugs affecting carbohydrate metabolism
