# Echocardiogram

**Definition/Overview**
- Echocardiography is a non-invasive ultrasound-based diagnostic modality for assessing cardiac structure and function.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Chest pain
- Shortness of breath
- Syncope
- Palpitations
- Peripheral embolic events

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- **Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE)**: Standard views include parasternal long and short axis, apical (4-chamber, 5-chamber, 2-chamber), subcostal, and suprasternal notch.
- **Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE)**: Used when TTE is nondiagnostic or for detailed assessment of posterior heart structures, infective endocarditis, or intracardiac thrombi.
- **Stress Echocardiography**: Assesses cardiac function under physical or pharmacological stress to diagnose coronary artery disease.
- **Strain Rate Echocardiography**: Detects subclinical wall motion abnormalities.
- **3D Echocardiography**: Provides detailed images for pre-surgical planning and assessment of complex anatomy.
- **Contrast Echocardiography**: Enhances visualization of cardiac structures and flow patterns, particularly for shunt detection and myocardial perfusion.

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Valvular heart disease
- Cardiomyopathies
- Pericardial disease
- Aortic pathology
- Pulmonary hypertension
- Congenital heart defects

**Treatment Options**
- Treatment is based on specific findings from the echocardiogram, such as valve repair/replacement for valvular disease, medical therapy for heart failure, or interventional procedures for congenital defects.

**Critical Considerations**
- TEE is contraindicated in esophageal pathology.
- Stress echocardiography should not be performed in acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
- Contrast echocardiography requires consideration of potential interference with visualization of intracardiac thrombi.

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Echocardiography is critical for diagnosing a wide range of cardiac conditions, from common diseases like ischemic heart disease to rare congenital anomalies.
- Pathophysiological insights from echocardiography guide the management of cardiac diseases, including hemodynamic assessment and myocardial function.

**Equipment**
- Echocardiography machine with transducers for TTE and TEE, contrast agents, and stress testing equipment.

**Personnel**
- Cardiologists, echocardiography technicians, and, for TEE, anesthesiologists or trained sedation providers.

**Preparation**
- TTE requires minimal preparation, while TEE requires sedation and potentially intubation.

**Technique or Treatment**
- TTE involves multiple acoustic windows to visualize cardiac structures; TEE involves probe insertion into the esophagus; stress echocardiography involves imaging at rest and during/after stress.

**Complications**
- TTE and stress echocardiography have minimal risks; TEE risks include esophageal trauma and sedation-related complications.

**Clinical Significance**
- Echocardiography provides essential diagnostic and prognostic information, influencing the management and therapeutic decisions for various cardiac conditions.
