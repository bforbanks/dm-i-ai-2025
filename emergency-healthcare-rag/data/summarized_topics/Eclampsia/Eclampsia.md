# Eclampsia

**Definition/Overview**
- Eclampsia is a severe obstetric complication characterized by new-onset seizures in patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, without other neurological causes, potentially occurring before, during, or after labor.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Generalized tonic-clonic seizures
- Severe headaches
- Visual disturbances
- Altered mental status
- Hypertension
- Proteinuria (may be absent)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Seizures in the absence of other neurological causes in a hypertensive pregnant patient
- Blood pressure â‰¥140/90 mm Hg
- New-onset seizures can be tonic-clonic, focal, or multifocal
- Laboratory findings may include liver dysfunction, renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, and proteinuria

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Seizure disorders
- Metabolic abnormalities
- Cerebral venous thrombosis
- Space-occupying brain lesions
- Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome
- Infectious meningitis or encephalitis
- Chronic renal or hepatic disease
- Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures
- Antiphospholipid syndrome
- Hemolytic-uremic syndrome
- Amniotic fluid emboli
- Immune thrombocytopenic purpura
- Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
- Toxins
- Ruptured aneurysm
- Intracranial hemorrhage

**Treatment Options**
- Immediate seizure control with magnesium sulfate: 6 g IV loading dose, followed by 2 g/hour maintenance
- Alternative antiseizure therapies if contraindicated: phenytoin, diazepam, levetiracetam
- Antihypertensive management: hydralazine, labetalol, nifedipine
- Delivery considerations: timing based on clinical features, gestational age, fetal presentation, cervical favorability
- Postpartum monitoring for seizure recurrence and complications

**Critical Considerations**
- Magnesium sulfate toxicity monitoring and management
- Blood pressure control to prevent maternal-fetal morbidity
- Delivery method and timing
- Postpartum care and seizure risk monitoring

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Affects 10-20% of pregnancies in the US, with eclampsia estimated at 0.3% globally
- Pathophysiology involves uteroplacental ischemia, BBB dysfunction, cerebral blood flow autoregulation, and systemic inflammation
- Risk factors include chronic hypertension, maternal obesity, autoimmune disorders, and multifetal gestation

**Prognosis**
- Increased risk of recurrent preeclampsia and eclampsia in future pregnancies
- Elevated long-term risk of cardiovascular complications and cognitive challenges

**Complications**
- Placental abruption
- HELLP syndrome
- Disseminated intravascular coagulation
- Pulmonary edema
- Aspiration pneumonia
- Cardiopulmonary arrest
- Acute renal failure
- Blood transfusion
- Venous thromboembolism

**Deterrence and Patient Education**
- Importance of recognizing signs and symptoms of eclampsia
- Adherence to hypertensive medication and regular obstetric follow-up
- Low-dose aspirin for primary prevention
- Secondary prevention includes monitoring, blood pressure regulation, timely delivery, and magnesium sulfate prophylaxis
