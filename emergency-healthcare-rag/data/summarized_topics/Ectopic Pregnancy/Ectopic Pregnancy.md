# Ectopic Pregnancy

**Definition/Overview**
- Ectopic pregnancy is the implantation of a fertilized egg outside the uterine cavity, most commonly in the fallopian tube, and is a potentially life-threatening condition.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Lower abdominal pain, typically unilateral
- Vaginal bleeding
- Dizziness or fainting
- Shoulder pain
- Severe pelvic pain, indicating possible rupture

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Serum β-hCG levels: absence of intrauterine pregnancy with levels >2000 mIU/mL suggestive of ectopic pregnancy
- Transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS): most sensitive for early detection
- Transabdominal ultrasonography (TAUS): less sensitive than TVUS
- β-hCG trends: slower rise or decrease indicative of ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage
- Discriminatory β-hCG level: up to 3500 mIU/mL for TVUS visibility of intrauterine pregnancy

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Ovarian torsion
- Tubo-ovarian abscess
- Appendicitis
- Hemorrhagic corpus luteum
- Ovarian cyst rupture
- Threatened miscarriage
- Incomplete miscarriage
- Pelvic inflammatory disease
- Ureteral calculi

**Treatment Options**
- Medical management: methotrexate (contraindications include hemodynamic instability, blood dyscrasias, organ dysfunction, unreliable follow-up)
- Surgical management: salpingostomy or salpingectomy, depending on the patient's hemodynamic stability, β-hCG levels, ultrasound findings, and fertility desires
- Expectant management: for asymptomatic patients with low and declining β-hCG levels

**Critical Considerations**
- Ectopic pregnancy rupture can lead to severe hemorrhage and shock
- Methotrexate contraindications and monitoring
- Surgical intervention urgency in cases of rupture
- Fertility preservation considerations

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Prevalence: 1-2% of pregnancies; higher in assisted reproductive technology cases
- Pathophysiology: tubal dysfunction due to inflammation, damage, or congenital anomalies
- Rare presentations: cervical, ovarian, abdominal, interstitial, and cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies

**Complications**
- Tubal rupture
- Severe hemorrhage
- Hemodynamic shock
- Fertility impairment
- Recurrent ectopic pregnancy
- Adhesion formation
- Emotional and psychological distress

**Deterrence and Patient Education**
- Early prenatal care and symptom awareness
- Risk factor modification (e.g., smoking cessation, STI prevention)
- Importance of early pregnancy testing and ultrasound evaluation
- Counseling on methotrexate interactions and postoperative care
