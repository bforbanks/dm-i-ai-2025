# Embolism

**Definition/Overview**
- Embolism refers to the obstruction of a blood vessel by a clot or other material (embolus) that has traveled from elsewhere in the circulation.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Dyspnea
- Chest pain
- Cough
- Syncope
- Hemodynamic instability
- Signs of right ventricular strain

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Clinical probability scoring (Wells, Geneva)
- D-dimer levels
- CT pulmonary angiography
- Ultrasound
- ECG findings (e.g., S1Q3T3 pattern, right ventricular strain)
- Arterial blood gas analysis
- Elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and troponin levels

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Acute coronary syndrome
- Pneumonia
- Pneumothorax
- Congestive heart failure
- Vasovagal syncope

**Treatment Options**
- Supportive measures (oxygen, mechanical ventilation)
- Anticoagulation (LMWH, fondaparinux, UFH, NOACs, VKA)
- Reperfusion strategies (thrombolysis, catheter-directed therapy, surgical embolectomy)
- Long-term anticoagulation based on individual risk factors

**Critical Considerations**
- Hemodynamic stability assessment
- Risk of recurrent VTE
- Complications such as chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure
- ECG progression and complications

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Incidence: 39 to 115 per 100,000 annually for PE, 53 to 162 per 100,000 for DVT
- Pathophysiology involves obstruction of pulmonary vascular bed, ventilation-perfusion mismatch, hypoxemia, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and right ventricular failure
- Rare presentations include paradoxical embolism through a patent foramen ovale

**Fat Embolism**
- Fat embolism (FE) and fat embolism syndrome (FES) involve systemic dissemination of fat emboli, often following orthopedic trauma or nontraumatic conditions like pancreatitis.
- FES presents with respiratory insufficiency, cerebral involvement, and petechial rash.
- Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria (Gurd and Wilson) and supportive imaging and lab findings.
- Treatment is supportive, with oxygen, hemodynamic stabilization, and potential use of corticosteroids being controversial.
- Prognosis varies, with mortality rates between 7% to 10% for traumatic FES, depending on early intervention and supportive care.
