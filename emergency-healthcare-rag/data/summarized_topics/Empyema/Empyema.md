# Empyema

**Definition/Overview**
- Empyema of the gallbladder, a severe form of acute cholecystitis, is characterized by pus accumulation within the gallbladder due to cystic duct obstruction and bile stasis, necessitating surgical intervention.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Right upper quadrant tenderness
- Positive Murphy sign
- High fever, chills, rigors
- Signs of systemic sepsis
- Palpable, acutely tender gallbladder (in severe cases)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Leukocytosis with left shift
- Elevated liver enzymes, abnormal PT/aPTT
- Ultrasound: edematous gallbladder, echogenic contents with gallstones
- CT: enlarged gallbladder, edematous walls, pericholecystic collection
- MRI: distinguishes pus from sludge, may show fluid levels

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Acute cholecystitis
- Gallstones
- Biliary colic

**Treatment Options**
- Parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics
- Hydration and optimization for surgery
- Cholecystectomy (laparoscopic with low threshold to convert to open)
- Percutaneous or transhepatic gallbladder drainage in high-risk patients
- Postoperative IV antibiotics until fever and WBC normalize

**Critical Considerations**
- Urgent surgical intervention to prevent septic shock
- Higher conversion rate from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy in empyema
- Increased risk of postoperative complications: wound infection, bleeding, bile duct injury, subhepatic abscess, cystic duct stump leak

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Occurs in 5-15% of acute cholecystitis cases
- Higher morbidity in older patients, males, and those with diabetes or immunosuppression
- Pathogens: _Escherichia coli_, _Klebsiella_, _Streptococcus faecalis_, anaerobes (_Bacteroides_, _Clostridia_)
- Complications: sepsis, gallbladder gangrene, perforation, fistula formation
