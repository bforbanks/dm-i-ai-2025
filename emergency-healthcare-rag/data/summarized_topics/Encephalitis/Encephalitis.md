# Encephalitis

**Definition/Overview**
- Encephalitis caused by free-living amoebae, including primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) and granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE), is a rare but often fatal CNS infection.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- **PAM:**
  - Acute onset of fever, severe headache, photophobia, nausea, vomiting
  - Behavioral abnormalities, seizures, altered mental status
  - Meningismus, cranial nerve palsies
- **GAE:**
  - Subacute to chronic headache, low-grade fevers, visual disturbances
  - Behavioral abnormalities, focal neurologic deficits
  - Increased intracranial pressure, seizures, coma

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- **PAM:**
  - CSF analysis: leukocytosis with left shift, high opening pressure, polymorphonuclear predominance, hypoglycorrhachia, elevated protein
  - Observation of motile trophozoites on CSF wet mount
  - Positive _Naegleria fowleri_ nucleic acid or antigen in CSF, biopsy, or tissue specimens
- **GAE:**
  - Brain biopsy: trophozoites and cysts, granulomatous inflammation
  - CSF: mild pleocytosis with lymphocytic predominance, high protein, low/normal glucose
  - MRI: single/multiple space-occupying lesions with ring enhancement
  - CT: hydrocephalus, meningeal thickening, pseudotumoral lesions

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Acute bacterial meningitis, brain abscesses, tuberculosis, CNS aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, _Histoplasma_, toxoplasmosis, cysticercosis, CNS lymphoma

**Treatment Options**
- **PAM:**
  - Amphotericin B intravenously and intrathecally
  - Combination therapy: rifampin, fluconazole, miltefosine, azithromycin
  - Posaconazole as potential alternative
- **GAE:**
  - Combination therapy: pentamidine, sulfadiazine, flucytosine, fluconazole/itraconazole
  - Surgical resection of brain lesions may be beneficial
- **_Sappinia_ GAE:**
  - Flucytosine, itraconazole, pentamidine isethionate, azithromycin

**Critical Considerations**
- Rapid progression of PAM with high intracranial pressure, uncal herniation, and death
- GAE's chronic course with potential for disseminated disease, skin disease, and keratitis

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- PAM: _Naegleria fowleri_, thermophilic, found in warm freshwater; infects via nasal mucosa
- GAE: _Acanthamoeba_ spp., found in soil, water; infects via eyes, nasal passages, respiratory tract, or skin; causes CNS invasion, abscess, and granuloma formation
- Rare, with 3.7 cases/year worldwide; PAM more common in warm regions and in younger males
