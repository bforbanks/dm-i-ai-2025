# Endocarditis

**Definition/Overview**
- Infective endocarditis is an infection of the endocardial surface of the heart, which may involve native or prosthetic valves, or implanted cardiac devices.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Fever, chills, dyspnea, orthopnea, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss
- New or changing heart murmur, signs of heart failure
- Neurological deficits, splinter hemorrhages, Osler nodes, Roth spots, Janeway lesions
- Organomegaly, hematuria, arrhythmias, anorexia

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Modified Duke Criteria for definite infective endocarditis: 
  - Pathological criteria: Microorganisms on culture/histology of vegetation or intracardiac abscess
  - Clinical criteria: Two major, one major + three minor, or five minor criteria
- Major clinical criteria include positive blood cultures, endocardial involvement, and presence of vegetation or abscess
- Minor clinical criteria include predisposing heart condition, fever, vascular and immunologic phenomena
- Echocardiographic findings: Myocardial abscess, new valvular regurgitation, oscillating intracardiac mass, prosthetic valve dehiscence
- ECG: Conduction block or delay in ~10% of patients

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, Libmanâ€“Sacks endocarditis, vasculitis, connective tissue disease, fever of unknown origin

**Treatment Options**
- Antibiotic therapy tailored to pathogen and susceptibility, including IV penicillin, gentamicin, vancomycin, cefazolin, daptomycin, and antifungals like amphotericin B
- Surgical intervention for valve dysfunction, uncontrolled infection, fungal endocarditis, or complications such as heart block or abscess
- Valve repair or replacement, use of biological stentless valves or homografts

**Critical Considerations**
- ECG progression to heart block indicates poor prognosis
- Early initiation of antimicrobial therapy reduces stroke risk
- Anticoagulation discontinuation may be necessary post-central nervous system embolic event

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Global occurrence, with _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Streptococcus viridans_ as common pathogens
- Pathophysiology involves bacteremia, adherence to valve surface, and invasion of valvular leaflets
- Epidemiology varies with healthcare exposure, invasive procedures, and patient comorbidities
- Rare presentations include fungal endocarditis and embolic events from vegetation

**Contraindications & Warnings**
- Prior antibiotic therapy may mask histopathological evidence
- Aminoglycosides and rifampin have specific contraindications due to toxicity risks
- Anticoagulation in mechanical valve endocarditis with CNS embolic events requires careful consideration
