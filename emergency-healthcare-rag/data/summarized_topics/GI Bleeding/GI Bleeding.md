# GI Bleeding

**Definition/Overview**
- Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a potentially life-threatening condition that can arise from various sources within the digestive tract, categorized as upper or lower GI bleeding based on the location relative to the ligament of Treitz.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Hematemesis: vomiting of blood
- Melena: dark, tarry stools with a strong odor
- Hematochezia: passage of bright red blood per rectum
- Signs of hemodynamic instability: tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, supine hypotension
- Abdominal pain, anal fissures, hemorrhoids, anorectal mass

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Complete blood count, hemoglobin/hematocrit, coagulation profile (INR, PT, aPTT), lactate, liver function tests
- Upper GI endoscopy for visualization and treatment of upper GI sources
- Lower GI endoscopy/colonoscopy for visualization and treatment of lower GI sources
- Nuclear scintigraphy (Tagged RBC scan) for active bleeding detection
- CT angiography and standard angiography for identification of actively bleeding vessels
- Meckel scan for ectopic gastric mucosa

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Upper GI: Peptic ulcer disease, esophagitis, gastritis, varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy, angiodysplasia, Dieulafoy lesion, gastric antral valvular ectasia, Mallory-Weiss tears, Cameron lesions, aortoenteric fistulas, foreign body ingestion, upper GI tumors, hemobilia, hemosuccus pancreaticus
- Lower GI: Diverticulosis, angiodysplasia, infectious colitis, ischemic colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, hemorrhoids, anal fissures, rectal varices, radiation-induced colitis

**Treatment Options**
- Resuscitation with IV fluids, blood transfusions (RBCs, platelets, prothrombin complex concentrate)
- Medications: PPIs, prokinetic agents, vasoactive medications (somatostatin, octreotide), antibiotics for cirrhosis patients, cessation/reversal of anticoagulants/antiplatelets
- Endoscopic interventions: injection therapy, thermal coagulation, hemostatic clips/bands
- Surgery for unmanageable bleeding or hemodynamic instability
- Specific treatments for diverticular bleeding (bipolar probe coagulation, epinephrine injection, metallic clips) and angiodysplasia (thermal therapy)

**Critical Considerations**
- Risk stratification using AIMS65, Rockall, and Oakland scores
- Monitoring in ICU for hemodynamically unstable patients
- Avoidance of NSAIDs and alcohol to minimize risk factors
- Regular follow-up with a gastroenterologist for monitoring and prevention of recurrence

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- UGIB incidence: ~67/100,000 population; LGIB incidence: ~36/100,000 population
- UGIB more common in men; incidence increases with age
- Pathophysiology varies by etiology, including vascular malformations (Dieulafoy lesion), mucosal erosion (peptic ulcer disease), and increased portal pressure (varices)

**Prognosis**
- UGIB in-hospital mortality ~10%, long-term mortality ~37% at three years
- LGIB in-hospital mortality <4%, death from LGIB itself is rare
- Prognosis worsens with age, malignancies, variceal bleeds, and comorbid conditions

**Complications**
- Respiratory distress, myocardial infarction, infection, shock, death

- Gastroenterology, critical care, general surgery, interventional radiology
