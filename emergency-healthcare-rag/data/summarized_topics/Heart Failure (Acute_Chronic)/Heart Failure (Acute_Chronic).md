# Heart Failure (Acute_Chronic)

**Definition/Overview**
- Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome where the heart cannot pump blood effectively, leading to fluid buildup and pulmonary edema, known as congestive heart failure (CHF).

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Dyspnea (exertional, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal)
- Fatigue
- Edema (peripheral, ascites)
- Tachycardia
- Jugular venous distension
- Hepatomegaly
- S3 gallop
- Pulmonary rales

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- LVEF classifications: HFrEF (≤40%), HFmrEF (41-49%), HFpEF (≥50%)
- Elevated natriuretic peptides (BNP, NT-proBNP)
- ECG abnormalities (ischemia, arrhythmias)
- Chest X-ray: pulmonary congestion
- Echocardiography: structural abnormalities, diastolic dysfunction
- ACC/AHA Stages: A (at risk) to D (advanced HF)
- NYHA Functional Classification: I (least severe) to IV (most severe)

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Valvular heart disease
- Renal failure
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome
- Pulmonary embolism
- Acute coronary syndrome

**Treatment Options**
- Lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise)
- Pharmacotherapy: ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, diuretics, MRAs, SGLT-2 inhibitors
- Device therapy: ICD, CRT
- Advanced therapies: LVAD, heart transplantation
- Palliative care for end-stage HF

**Critical Considerations**
- Monitor for ECG progression and complications
- Adjust treatment based on NYHA class and symptom severity
- Consider comorbidities (renal dysfunction, diabetes, COPD)
- Manage acute decompensated HF and flash pulmonary edema promptly

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Prevalence increases with age; common in elderly
- Pathophysiology: impaired ventricular function, diastolic dysfunction, systemic and pulmonary congestion
- Risk factors: hypertension, CAD, diabetes, obesity
- HFpEF often presents with normal ventricular structure but elevated LVFPs
