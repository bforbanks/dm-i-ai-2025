# Hemoglobin A1C

**Definition/Overview**
- Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), also known as glycated or glycosylated hemoglobin, is a blood test that measures average glucose control over the past 90 days and is used to diagnose and monitor diabetes mellitus.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Not applicable as HbA1c is a laboratory test.

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Normal: HbA1c <5.7%
- Prediabetes: HbA1c 5.7% to 6.4%
- Diabetes mellitus: HbA1c ≥6.5%
- Testing frequency: at least twice a year for stable diabetes, every 3 months if not meeting targets or therapy changes
- Standardized assays: NGSP-certified or IFCC-aligned methods

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Conditions that may affect HbA1c levels:
  - Hemoglobinopathies (e.g., sickle cell anemia, thalassemia)
  - Anemia, kidney failure, liver disease
  - Recent blood transfusions
  - High altitude, pregnancy, hemorrhage, erythropoietin administration, iron supplementation, hemolytic anemia, chronic kidney failure, liver cirrhosis, alcoholism, spherocytosis
  - Vitamin C supplementation, iron deficiency, hypertriglyceridemia, organ transplantation, certain medications

**Treatment Options**
- Not applicable as HbA1c is a diagnostic and monitoring tool, not a treatment.

**Critical Considerations**
- Ensure use of standardized testing methods (NGSP, IFCC)
- Interpret results cautiously in patients with conditions affecting red blood cell turnover
- Recognize potential for falsely low or high HbA1c values due to various interfering factors

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- HbA1c reflects long-term glycemic control, correlates with risk of microvascular complications, and is influenced by red blood cell lifespan (approximately 3 months)
- Tight glucose control (HbA1c ≤7%) reduces microvascular complications in type 1 diabetes
- Long-term cardiovascular risk and mortality benefits associated with lower HbA1c levels

**Testing Procedures**
- Methods: HPLC, immunoassays, enzymatic assays, capillary electrophoresis
- POC devices available but may have reduced accuracy compared to laboratory assays
- Sample type: venous blood (standard), capillary blood (acceptable)
- No fasting required for the test

**Quality Control and Lab Safety**
- Internal and external quality control measures required
- ADA precision standards: intralaboratory CV <2%, interlaboratory CV ≤3.5%
- Laboratory safety protocols must be followed to ensure accurate results
