# Hemothorax

**Definition/Overview**
- Hemothorax is the accumulation of blood in the pleural space, often resulting from traumatic thoracic injuries.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Respiratory distress
- Tachypnea
- Decreased or absent breath sounds
- Dullness to percussion
- Chest wall asymmetry
- Tracheal deviation
- Hypoxia
- Narrow pulse pressure
- Hypotension
- Signs of chest wall injury (e.g., "seat belt sign," paradoxical movement, ecchymosis)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) as part of the eFAST protocol for rapid detection
- Chest radiography for initial screening
- CT scan for detailed evaluation (when stable and available)
- Physical findings suggesting hemothorax (e.g., distended neck veins, paradoxical chest wall movement)
- Ultrasound features of hemothorax (anechoic space, "spine sign")
- Laboratory work-up: CBC, CMP, troponin, coagulation profile, type and screen

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Pneumothorax
- Pulmonary contusion
- Tracheobronchial injuries
- Esophageal injury
- Flail chest
- Rib fracture
- Aortic rupture
- Pericardial effusion/tamponade

**Treatment Options**
- ATLS protocol for initial resuscitation
- Tube thoracostomy for significant blood accumulation
- Surgical intervention for:
  * â‰¥1500 ml blood drainage in 24 hours
  * 300-500 ml/hour for 2-4 consecutive hours
  * Great vessel or chest wall injury
  * Pericardial tamponade
- Video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) for retained hemothorax
- Correction of coagulopathy prior to surgical intervention when possible

**Critical Considerations**
- Monitoring for complications such as empyema and fibrothorax
- Serial imaging and labs to assess for evolving conditions
- Consideration of coagulopathy in management decisions

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Traumatic hemothorax has a mortality rate of 9.4%
- Each hemithorax can hold up to 40% of a patient's blood volume
- Pathophysiology involves hemodynamic and respiratory compromise due to blood accumulation
- Non-traumatic causes include iatrogenic factors, lung sequestration, vascular issues, neoplasia, coagulopathies, and infections
