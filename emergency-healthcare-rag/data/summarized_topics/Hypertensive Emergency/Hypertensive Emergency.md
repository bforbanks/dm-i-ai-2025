# Hypertensive Emergency

**Definition/Overview**
- Hypertensive emergency is an acute, marked elevation in blood pressure with signs of target-organ damage, including pulmonary edema, cardiac ischemia, neurologic deficits, acute renal failure, aortic dissection, and eclampsia.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Headache
- Dizziness
- Altered mental status
- Shortness of breath
- Chest pain
- Decreased urine output
- Vomiting
- Changes in vision
- Neurologic deficits (e.g., aphasia, unilateral weakness)
- Cardiac dysfunction (e.g., rales, jugular venous distention, peripheral edema)
- Renal failure signs (e.g., pulmonary edema)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Blood pressure markedly above baseline with acute target-organ damage
- Labs: metabolic panels, urinalysis, B-natriuretic peptide, cardiac enzymes
- Imaging: ECG, head CT, chest x-ray, CT angiography for aortic dissection

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Acute kidney injury
- Aortic coarctation
- Chronic kidney disease
- Eclampsia
- Hypocalcemia
- Hyperthyroidism
- Pheochromocytoma
- Renal artery stenosis
- Subarachnoid hemorrhage

**Treatment Options**
- Lower mean arterial pressure by 20-25% within 1-2 hours
- IV vasoactive drips: labetalol, esmolol, nicardipine, nitroglycerin
- Avoid oral medications like clonidine and nifedipine in immediate management
- In pregnancy: IV hydralazine or oral nifedipine; avoid ACE inhibitors or ARBs

**Critical Considerations**
- Continuous blood pressure monitoring
- Assess for target organ injury
- Lower blood pressure to below 140 mmHg in the first hour for aortic dissection
- Gradual reduction to 160/100 mmHg over 2-6 hours, then to normal over 2 days for adults without organ damage

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- 30% of adults in America have hypertension; 1-2% experience hypertensive crisis
- Pathophysiology: endothelial damage, pro-inflammatory response, vascular permeability, platelet activation, fibrin clot deposition
- Fibrinoid necrosis in kidney arterioles indicates malignant hypertension
- Long-term prognosis is guarded with potential for adverse cardiac events or stroke within 12 months
