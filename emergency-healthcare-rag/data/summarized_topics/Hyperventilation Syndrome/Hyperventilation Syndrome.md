# Hyperventilation Syndrome

**Definition/Overview**
- Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is a critical condition characterized by elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) above 20 mmHg, leading to end-organ damage and potential multisystem organ failure.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Tense, distended abdomen
- Decreased urine output
- Respiratory distress
- Hypotension
- Tachycardia
- Altered mental status

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- IAP > 20 mmHg with new organ dysfunction
- WSACS IAH grading: 
  * Grade I: IAP 12-15 mm Hg
  * Grade II: IAP 16-20 mm Hg
  * Grade III: IAP 21-25 mm Hg
  * Grade IV: IAP >25 mm Hg
- Indirect IAP measurement via intravesicular catheter pressures is standard

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Mesenteric ischemia
- Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm
- Toxic megacolon
- Acute appendicitis
- Acute diverticulitis

**Treatment Options**
- Non-surgical: nasogastric decompression, rectal tube decompression, percutaneous drainage, sedation, neuromuscular blockade, fluid management
- Surgical: emergent laparotomy, temporary open abdomen with negative pressure dressing, subsequent fascial closure with mesh or primary techniques

**Critical Considerations**
- Early identification and intervention are crucial to reverse organ dysfunction
- Surgical decompression timing is debated; indicated when conservative measures fail
- Complications of surgical decompression include fistula, protein loss, hernia, infection, recurrent ACS

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Prevalence: Up to 48.9% in critically ill patients within 14 days of ICU admission
- Pathophysiology: Elevated IAP affects cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems, leading to organ dysfunction
- Rare presentations: Chronic IAH in pregnancy, cirrhosis, obesity, malignancy, peritoneal dialysis
