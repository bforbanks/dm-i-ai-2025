# Hypoglycemia

**Definition/Overview**
- Factitious hypoglycemia is the intentional self-induction of low blood glucose levels, posing diagnostic challenges and leading to unnecessary investigations.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Tremors
- Sweating
- Dizziness
- Irritability
- Hunger
- Weakness
- Altered mental status
- Seizures or coma
- Tachycardia and hypothermia (vital signs)
- Diaphoresis (skin examination)
- Insulin needle marks (in non-prescribed individuals)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Whipple triad:
  - Hypoglycemic signs and symptoms
  - Blood glucose levels <70 mg/dL
  - Resolution of symptoms after glucose administration
- Laboratory tests during hypoglycemia:
  - Plasma insulin (elevated in exogenous insulin use)
  - C peptide (low in exogenous insulin use)
  - Proinsulin (low in exogenous insulin use)
  - Insulin secretagogues blood levels
  - Insulin to C peptide ratio >1 (in exogenous insulin use)
  - Positive drug screen for sulfonylureas or meglitinides

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Alcohol intake
- Hormonal deficiency (e.g., cortisol)
- Non-islet cell tumors
- Insulinoma
- Insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia
- Accidental hypoglycemia
- Secondary causes in diabetes mellitus (infection, sepsis, TIA)

**Treatment Options**
- Immediate:
  - Oral glucose or glucagon injections (out-of-hospital)
  - IV glucose and hydrocortisone (in-hospital for comatose patients)
  - Continuous IV glucose infusions (1-2 days)
- Additional therapy for sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia:
  - Octreotide (IV or subcutaneous)
- Long-term:
  - Psychotherapy
  - Collaboration with a psychiatrist

**Critical Considerations**
- Avoid bolus glucose administration in sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia
- Continuous monitoring of serum glucose levels
- Consider psychiatric evaluation for underlying disorders

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- More common in women with diabetes, particularly in the third and fourth decades
- Insulin and C peptide produced by pancreatic Î²-cells, with C peptide having a longer half-life
- Exogenous insulin administration leads to high insulin levels with low C peptide and proinsulin levels
- Sulfonylureas and meglitinides increase endogenous insulin production, elevating insulin, C peptide, and proinsulin levels
