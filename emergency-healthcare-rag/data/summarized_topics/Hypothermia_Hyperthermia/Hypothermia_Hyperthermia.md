# Hypothermia_Hyperthermia

**Definition/Overview**
- Hyperthermia: Body temperature >40°C due to failure of thermoregulation.
- Hypothermia: Body temperature <35°C due to excessive heat loss or inadequate heat production.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Hyperthermia: Delirium, decreased consciousness, ataxia, orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, diaphoresis, tachypnea.
- Hypothermia: Shivering, lethargy, cognitive decline, hyporeflexia, dilated pupils, bradycardia, bradypnea, potential arrhythmias.

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Hyperthermia: Core body temperature >40°C, CNS involvement.
- Hypothermia: Core body temperature <35°C, severity classified as mild (32-35°C), moderate (28-32°C), severe (<28°C).

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Hyperthermia: Sepsis, toxic ingestions, withdrawal states, medication reactions (e.g., neuroleptic malignant syndrome).
- Hypothermia: Extremes of age, hypoglycemia, malnutrition, endocrine disorders, CNS trauma, substance abuse, iatrogenic causes.

**Treatment Options**
- Hyperthermia: Evaporative cooling, ice-water immersion, ice packs, cooled IV fluids, cooling devices (catheters, adhesive pads).
- Hypothermia: Passive external rewarming, active external rewarming, active internal rewarming, extracorporeal rewarming (hemodialysis, ECMO).

**Critical Considerations**
- Hyperthermia: Monitor for shivering, avoid hypothermia, skin damage prevention.
- Hypothermia: Gentle handling to prevent arrhythmias, monitor core temperature, manage comorbid conditions, rewarming strategies based on severity.

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Hyperthermia: Common in athletes, extremes of age, obese, mentally ill; failure of thermoregulatory system.
- Hypothermia: Common in cold areas or during cooler months; affects all organ systems, with altered hypothalamic regulation and peripheral response to cold stress.
