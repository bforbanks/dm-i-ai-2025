# Interstitial Lung Disease

**Definition/Overview**
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) encompasses a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by lung fibrosis and is classified based on clinical, radiographic, physiologic, or pathologic factors.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Gradual onset of dyspnea
- Persistent cough (e.g., in bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia)
- Pleuritic chest pain (in some subtypes like sarcoidosis)
- Hemoptysis (from diffuse alveolar hemorrhages)
- Bibasilar crackles on physical exam
- Digital clubbing or signs of pulmonary hypertension in advanced disease

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Detailed patient history and physical exam
- Laboratory testing: CBC, hepatic and renal function, serologic studies, possibly infectious studies
- Imaging: Chest radiograph (reticular, nodular, or mixed patterns), HRCT (subpleural and basilar predominant changes, reticular patterns, honeycomb changes with or without traction bronchiectasis)
- Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for differential diagnosis (e.g., lymphocytosis in hypersensitivity pneumonitis)
- Lung biopsy for specific diagnoses (e.g., sarcoidosis, idiopathic interstitial pneumonia)
- Pulmonary function tests and oximetry for prognostication and monitoring

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Pulmonary edema
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
- Bacterial, fungal, or viral pneumonia

**Treatment Options**
- Avoidance of known irritants
- Smoking cessation, pulmonary rehabilitation, pulmonary hygiene
- Supplemental oxygen for hypoxemia (SaO2 < 88%)
- Corticosteroids for BOOP, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and other responsive conditions
- Immunosuppressive therapies (nintedanib, pirfenidone for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis)
- Lung transplant for irreversible fibrosis

**Critical Considerations**
- Early intervention may improve responsiveness to therapy
- Once fibrosis is established, it is irreversible but progression can be slowed
- Monitoring for complications such as worsening hypoxia, cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary hypertension, infections

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Estimated incidence: 30 per 100,000 per year
- Prevalence: 80.9 per 100,000 per year in males, 67.2 per 100,000 per year in females
- Pathophysiology involves inflammation and fibrosis of lung parenchyma, potentially triggered by known agents or occurring spontaneously
- Genetic factors may contribute to idiopathic forms
