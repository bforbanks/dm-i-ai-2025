# Lactate

**Definition/Overview**
- Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of lactate to pyruvate, playing a key role in anaerobic metabolism. Ringer's lactate solution is an isotonic fluid used for volume resuscitation and contains sodium lactate, which serves as a bioenergetic fuel under ischemic conditions.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Elevated LDH levels may indicate tissue damage or disease but are not specific to a particular condition.

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Normal LDH range: 140-280 U/L (adults), with variations in infants and children.
- LDH isozyme electrophoresis distinguishes between LDH-1 to LDH-5 based on tissue-specific damage.
- Elevated LDH in serum or body fluids can indicate tissue damage, myocardial infarction, liver injury, or malignancy.

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Conditions causing increased LDH include liver disease, anemia, myocardial infarction, fractures, muscle trauma, cancers, infections, and more.

**Treatment Options**
- Treatment is condition-specific and not directly related to LDH levels.
- Ringer's lactate is used for volume resuscitation in various clinical situations, including blood loss, burn injuries, sepsis, and acute pancreatitis.

**Critical Considerations**
- LDH levels must be interpreted with caution due to non-specificity and potential interference from hemolysis or medications.
- Ringer's lactate should be used cautiously in patients with liver dysfunction, cerebral edema, or at risk of fluid overload.

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- LDH is ubiquitous in tissues, with isozymes varying in concentration across different tissues.
- LDH plays a role in the Warburg effect in cancer cells, where it supports anaerobic metabolism even in the presence of oxygen.
- LDH deficiency is rare and can lead to conditions like glycogen storage disease XI or affect cardiac muscle function.

**Contraindications & Monitoring**
- Ringer's lactate contraindications include liver dysfunction and cerebral edema requiring osmotic therapy.
- Monitor for fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and infusion-site reactions.
- Toxicity is associated with volume overload rather than the contents of Ringer's lactate itself.
