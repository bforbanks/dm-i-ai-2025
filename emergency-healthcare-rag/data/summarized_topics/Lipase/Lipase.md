# Lipase

**Definition/Overview**
- Lipases are enzymes that hydrolyze triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol, playing a critical role in lipid metabolism and absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Acute pancreatitis: Epigastric pain radiating to the back, nausea, vomiting
- Chronic pancreatitis: Steatorrhea, weight loss, diabetes mellitus
- Hyperchylomicronemia: Recurrent pancreatitis, hepatomegaly, xanthomas
- Atherosclerosis: Asymptomatic until cardiovascular events occur (e.g., myocardial infarction)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Acute pancreatitis: Two of the following three criteria: acute epigastric pain radiating to the back, serum amylase or lipase >3 times the upper limit of normal, and characteristic findings on CT or MRI
- Chronic pancreatitis: Evidence of chronic inflammation, calcification, and atrophy of the pancreas, with or without elevated serum lipase/amylase
- Hyperchylomicronemia: Serum triglycerides >1000 mg/dL, milky plasma appearance, genetic testing for LPL or apolipoprotein C2 deficiency

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Acute pancreatitis: Biliary colic, myocardial infarction, peptic ulcer disease
- Chronic pancreatitis: Celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, pancreatic cancer
- Hyperchylomicronemia: Other types of familial dyslipidemias, secondary hyperlipidemia

**Treatment Options**
- Acute pancreatitis: Supportive care, fluid resuscitation, pain management, nutritional support
- Chronic pancreatitis: Pancreatic enzyme replacement, pain management, treatment of diabetes mellitus and malabsorption
- Hyperchylomicronemia: Very low-fat diet, orlistat before meals to reduce pancreatitis risk

**Critical Considerations**
- Monitoring for complications of pancreatitis, such as pseudocyst, necrosis, abscess, hemorrhage, hypocalcemia, shock, and organ failure
- Consideration of rare genetic causes of hyperlipidemia and appropriate genetic counseling
- Awareness of medication side effects, such as orlistat's impact on fat-soluble vitamin absorption and fibrates' risk of myopathy, especially when combined with statins

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Acute pancreatitis: Commonly caused by gallstones, alcohol, hypertriglyceridemia, drugs
- Chronic pancreatitis: Often due to chronic alcohol abuse or genetic predispositions
- Hyperchylomicronemia: Autosomal recessive disorder with LPL or apolipoprotein C2 deficiency
- Lipases are involved in the pathophysiology of fat necrosis, pancreatitis, and atherosclerosis, with specific roles in different tissues and implications for cholesterol-lowering medications.
