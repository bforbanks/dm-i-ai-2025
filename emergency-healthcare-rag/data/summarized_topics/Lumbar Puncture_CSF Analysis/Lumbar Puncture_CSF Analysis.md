# Lumbar Puncture_CSF Analysis

**Definition/Overview**
- Lumbar puncture (LP) is a procedure to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, often performed under fluoroscopy guidance (FGLP) to increase accuracy and reduce complications.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Not directly applicable as LP is a diagnostic/therapeutic procedure, not a condition with symptoms.

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Indications for LP include CSF analysis for infection, malignancy, inflammatory disorders, CSF pressure measurement, chemotherapy, myelography, cisternography, CSF leak repair, baclofen pump trial, and lumbar shunt placement.
- FGLP is indicated for failed bedside LP attempts, obesity, prior lumbar surgery/hardware, severe degenerative disease, scoliosis, or upon patient request.
- Contraindications include uncorrected coagulopathy (INR <1.5, platelet count >50,000), recent anticoagulant use (specific withholding times for warfarin, heparin, lovenox, fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, argatroban, desirudin, aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, abciximab), increased intracranial pressure, and relative contraindications like infection at puncture site, uncooperative patient, and pregnancy.

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Not applicable as LP is a procedure, not a diagnosis.

**Treatment Options**
- LP procedure involves patient positioning (prone, prone oblique, lateral), local anesthesia, needle insertion (22 or 25 gauge, 3.5 or 5.5 inches), CSF collection (8-15 ml in 4 tubes), and pressure measurement (6-20 cm H2O, >25 cm H2O indicative of idiopathic intracranial hypertension).
- Complications management includes vasovagal syncope (rest), herniation (pre-procedure imaging), nerve/spinal cord injury (immediate cessation and repositioning), meningitis (aseptic technique), headache (bed rest, caffeine, epidural blood patch), vascular injury (vascular surgery consultation), and radiation exposure (minimize procedure time and dose).

**Critical Considerations**
- Ensure correct needle trajectory and depth to avoid complications.
- Monitor for CSF flow and adjust technique if radiating pain occurs.
- Measure CSF opening pressure accurately, considering patient position.
- Manage complications promptly and effectively.

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- LP is a common procedure with increasing use of FGLP due to higher success rates and lower complication rates compared to blind technique.
- Pathophysiology involves traversing skin, subcutaneous tissue, fascia, muscles, epidural fat, and dura to access the thecal sac containing CSF.
