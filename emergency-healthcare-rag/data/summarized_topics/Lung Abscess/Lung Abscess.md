# Lung Abscess

**Definition/Overview**
- A lung abscess is a localized collection of pus within the lung parenchyma, forming cavities larger than 2 cm due to microbial infection, often resulting from aspiration.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Fever, chills, cough
- Night sweats, chest pain
- Productive cough with necrotic debris (hallmark sign)
- Dyspnea, weight loss, fatigue
- Hemoptysis (occasionally)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Cavities >2 cm on imaging
- Chest radiographs and CT scans showing cavity with air-fluid level
- Sputum examination and bronchoscopy to identify causative agents
- Pleural fluid analysis if empyema is suspected

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Cavitary tuberculosis
- Lung carcinoma
- Pleural empyema
- Infected emphysematous bullae
- Cavitary pneumoconiosis
- Hydatid cyst of the lung
- Cavitary infarcts of lung
- Wegener granulomatosis
- Foreign body aspiration
- Septic pulmonary emboli

**Treatment Options**
- Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., beta-lactamase inhibitors, imipenem, meropenem)
- Vancomycin or linezolid for MRSA
- Surgical or percutaneous drainage for abscesses >6 cm or failed medical therapy
- Treatment duration typically 3 weeks, switch to oral antibiotics when stable

**Critical Considerations**
- Monitor for complications: pyopneumothorax, pleural empyema
- Adjust treatment based on specific pathogens identified
- Consider underlying causes in treatment-resistant cases

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Primary abscesses: aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions, often polymicrobial
- Secondary abscesses: bronchial obstructions, existing lung conditions, hematogenous spread
- Increased risk in immunocompromised patients, alcohol use disorder, poor dental hygiene
- Pathophysiology: aspiration pneumonia progresses to necrosis if untreated
