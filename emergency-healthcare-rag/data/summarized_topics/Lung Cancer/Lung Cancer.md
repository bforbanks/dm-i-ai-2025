# Lung Cancer

**Definition/Overview**
- Lung cancer, or bronchogenic carcinoma, refers to malignant tumors originating in the lung parenchyma or bronchi, leading in cancer-related deaths.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Cough (50-75% of patients)
- Hemoptysis (15-30%)
- Chest pain (20-40%)
- Dyspnea (25-40%)
- Pleural effusion
- Superior vena cava syndrome
- Pancoast syndrome (shoulder pain, Horner syndrome, atrophy of hand muscles)
- Bone pain with metastasis
- Paraneoplastic syndromes (e.g., hypercalcemia, SIADH, LEMS)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Imaging: Contrast-enhanced CT chest, PET or PET-CT
- Histopathology: WHO classification (adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, large cell carcinomas, etc.)
- Molecular testing for mutations (EGFR, KRAS, ALK, etc.)
- Staging: TNM classification, with additional limited/extensive staging for SCLC

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Bacterial, mycoplasmal, viral, and fungal pneumonia
- Bronchitis
- Pleural effusion
- Pneumothorax
- Tuberculosis

**Treatment Options**
- NSCLC: Surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy (e.g., EGFR inhibitors), immunotherapy (e.g., PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors)
- SCLC: Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, prophylactic cranial irradiation for limited-stage disease; chemotherapy with consideration for radiotherapy in extensive-stage disease

**Critical Considerations**
- Importance of accurate staging
- Risks of invasive procedures (e.g., mediastinoscopy)
- Potential complications from treatment (e.g., chemotherapy-induced nausea, nephrotoxicity)
- Prognosis varies significantly with stage and molecular markers

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- 225,000 new cases annually in the US
- Smoking is the primary cause (90% of cases)
- Pathophysiology involves genetic mutations and exposure to carcinogens
- Rare presentations include paraneoplastic syndromes and uncommon metastatic patterns

**Formatting Rules**
- Bolded section headers
- Bullet points under all sections except the overview
- Maintain clinical tone with no conversational language
