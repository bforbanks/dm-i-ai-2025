# MRI

**Definition/Overview**
- Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive diagnostic technique that provides detailed visualization of organs and soft tissues using magnetic properties of hydrogen molecules, without ionizing radiation.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Acute and subacute infarcts
- Headaches
- Seizures
- Neoplastic processes
- Chest wall abnormalities
- Abdominopelvic lesions and masses
- Internal derangements of joints
- Occult fractures
- Bone marrow edema
- Infiltrative processes of marrow space

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Neurological: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for hyperacute ischemia, MR angiography for vascular occlusive disease, MR venography for dural venous sinuses, post-contrast-enhanced lesions for multiple sclerosis
- Breast: Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI for disease extent, MR-guided biopsy for occult masses, non-contrast MRI for implant integrity
- Chest/Cardiac: Contrast-enhanced MRI for mediastinal involvement, late gadolinium enhancement for scarred tissue, T1 mapping for infiltrative cardiomyopathies
- Abdomen/Pelvis: Multiphase, post-contrast sequences for lesion characterization, MRI protocols for appendix evaluation in specific populations
- Musculoskeletal: MRI for joint support structures, bone lesions, and soft-tissue masses, modified techniques for postoperative assessment of arthroplasties

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Differentiation between benign and malignant lesions
- Determination of uterine vs. extra-uterine origin of pelvic masses
- Characterization of musculoskeletal abnormalities in conjunction with other imaging modalities

**Treatment Options**
- MRI is primarily a diagnostic tool and does not directly involve treatment but can guide clinical management and surgical planning.

**Critical Considerations**
- Contraindications: Gadolinium contrast contraindicated with glomerular filtration rate <30, avoid MRI contrast in pregnancy when possible
- Claustrophobia and anxiety management during MRI
- Screening for ferromagnetic materials and implanted device compatibility
- Minimizing artifacts from prosthetic devices

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- MRI is valuable for patients requiring routine imaging surveillance (e.g., multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel diseases) and "high radiation risk" patients (e.g., pregnant women, children).
- MRI utilizes the unique magnetic properties of tissues, particularly hydrogen, to generate images, and offers alternative non-contrast techniques for patients with contraindications to iodinated contrast or gadolinium.
