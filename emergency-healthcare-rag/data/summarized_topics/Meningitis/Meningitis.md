# Meningitis

**Definition/Overview**
- Bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening inflammation of the meninges caused by bacterial infection, necessitating prompt diagnosis and treatment.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Fever
- Neck stiffness
- Altered mental status
- Headache
- Confusion
- Nuchal rigidity
- Positive Kernig's or Brudzinski's signs
- Papilledema
- Purpura fulminans (suggestive of Meningococcal infection)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- CSF analysis: low glucose, high protein, neutrophil predominance
- CSF to serum glucose ratio
- Bacteria on Gram stain or culture
- Elevated C-reactive protein or procalcitonin levels
- Non-contrast CT scan before lumbar puncture if risk of herniation

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Viral, fungal, and other bacterial infections
- Noninfectious causes (cancer, medications, inflammatory conditions)
- Other CNS pathologies (brain abscess, CNS vasculitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage)

**Treatment Options**
- Empiric antibiotics: ceftriaxone, vancomycin, possibly ampicillin for age >50 or immunocompromised
- Specific antibiotics based on culture and sensitivities
- Dexamethasone for _S. pneumoniae_ infections
- Prophylactic treatment for close contacts of Meningococcal meningitis: ciprofloxacin, rifampin, or ceftriaxone

**Critical Considerations**
- Timely antibiotic administration (3-6 hours delay increases mortality)
- Monitoring for increased intracranial pressure
- Droplet precautions for suspected Meningococcal meningitis

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Incidence: 1.38 cases/100,000 population in the US
- Pathogens: _S. pneumoniae_, Group B _Streptococcus_, _N. meningitidis_, _H. influenzae_, _L. monocytogenes_
- Pathways: bacteremia, direct extension, dural defects, nosocomial
- Inflammatory response: activation of microglia, increased permeability, cerebral edema

**Aseptic Meningitis**
- Definition: Inflammation of the meninges with negative CSF bacterial cultures.
- Causes: Viruses (e.g., enteroviruses, HSV-2), mycobacteria, fungi, spirochetes, medications, malignancies.
- Symptoms: Headache, fever, neck stiffness, photophobia, malaise, weakness.
- Diagnosis: CSF pleocytosis, elevated WBC count, PCR, and other specific tests based on clinical presentation.
- Treatment: Supportive care, specific antiviral or antimicrobial therapy based on etiology.
- Prognosis: Generally benign with complete recovery, but varies with etiology and patient immune status.

**Viral Meningitis**
- Etiology: Primarily non-polio enteroviruses, HSV, VZV, arboviruses.
- Epidemiology: Incidence peaks in summer months, affects all ages, more common in children.
- Pathophysiology: Viral penetration of CNS via neuronal pathways or hematogenous seeding.
- Complications: Seizures, status epilepticus, neurological sequelae in severe cases.

**General Meningitis**
- Epidemiology: 8.7 million cases worldwide in 2015, 379,000 deaths.
- Etiology: Infectious (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites) and non-infectious causes.
- Pathophysiology: Hematogenous seeding or direct contiguous spread.
- Prognosis: Mortality rate close to 25%, varies by pathogen and patient characteristics.
- Complications: Hearing loss, cognitive and motor deficits, seizure disorders, increased intracranial pressure, hydrocephalus.
