# Mitral Regurgitation

**Definition/Overview**
- Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a common valvular heart disease that may require medical management or surgery, with transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR) being a minimally invasive option.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Acute volume overload
- Congestion
- Hemodynamic instability
- Symptoms of heart failure

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) for initial screening
- Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for detailed assessment
- Cardiac MRI as an alternative if TEE is contraindicated
- Severity assessment using parameters like jet to LA area ratio, vena contracta, EROA, regurgitant volume, and fraction

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Aortic valve stenosis
- Left ventricular or left atrial dysfunction
- Papillary muscle rupture
- Leaflet perforation from infective endocarditis

**Treatment Options**
- Medical management for mild, asymptomatic chronic MR
- Surgical intervention for symptomatic chronic MR, or asymptomatic with signs of LV dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, or pulmonary hypertension
- Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) for high-surgical-risk patients

**Critical Considerations**
- ECG progression
- Complications such as device embolization, leaflet injury, or single leaflet device attachment
- Contraindications like mitral valve stenosis or severe mitral annular calcification

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Second most common valvular abnormality
- Primary MR due to valve apparatus abnormalities
- Secondary MR due to alterations in LV or LA function/shape
- Rare presentations include extensive flail, Barlow disease, and mitral annular calcification
