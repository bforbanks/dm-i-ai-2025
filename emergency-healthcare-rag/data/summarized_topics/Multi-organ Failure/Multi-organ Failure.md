# Multi-organ Failure

**Definition/Overview**
- Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rapid deterioration of liver function, characterized by encephalopathy and impaired synthetic function (INR ≥ 1.5) in patients without preexisting liver disease, occurring within 26 weeks of onset.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Encephalopathy
- Coagulopathy (INR ≥ 1.5)
- Jaundice
- Hypotension
- Altered mental status
- Right upper quadrant discomfort
- Nausea

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- INR ≥ 1.5
- Absence of cirrhosis or preexisting liver disease
- Duration of illness <26 weeks
- Elevated bilirubin and aminotransferases
- Thrombocytopenia, anemia, hypoglycemia
- Elevated serum ammonia, creatinine
- Dyselectrolytemia (e.g., hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia)

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Acute fatty liver of pregnancy
- Amanita phalloides mushroom poisoning
- Bacillus cereus toxin
- Fructose intolerance
- Galactosemia
- HELLP syndrome
- Hemorrhagic viruses (Ebola, Lassa, Marburg)
- Idiopathic drug reaction
- Neonatal iron storage disease
- Tyrosinemia

**Treatment Options**
- Supportive care: IV fluids, vasopressors, blood products as needed, empirical antibiotics, nutrition, glucose maintenance, discontinuation of non-essential medications
- Specific treatments based on etiology:
  - N-acetyl cysteine for acetaminophen toxicity
  - Nucleos(t)ide analogs for hepatitis B
  - Intravenous methylprednisolone for autoimmune hepatitis
  - Gastric lavage, activated charcoal, and IV penicillin G for Amanita phalloides poisoning
  - Acyclovir for herpes hepatitis
  - Ganciclovir for CMV hepatitis
  - Prompt delivery for acute fatty liver of pregnancy or HELLP syndrome
- Management of complications: renal replacement therapy, broad-spectrum antibiotics, glucose and electrolyte management, ICP control, airway protection
- Liver transplantation for selected patients

**Critical Considerations**
- Monitor for progression to multi-organ dysfunction
- Early referral to a liver transplantation center
- Management of cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension
- Avoidance of unnecessary coagulopathy correction
- Consideration of extracorporeal liver-assist devices

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Etiology varies by region: viral hepatitis in developing countries, drug-induced (acetaminophen) in developed countries
- Pathophysiology involves hepatocyte necrosis/apoptosis, ATP depletion, altered BBB, and cerebral edema
- Rare variants include Wilson disease, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and various viral infections (HSV, CMV, EBV)
- Prognosis: 1-year survival >65% with liver transplantation, with prognostic criteria including King's College Criteria, Clichy criteria, MELD score, and APACHE II score.
