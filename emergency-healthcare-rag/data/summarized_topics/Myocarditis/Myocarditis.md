# Myocarditis

**Definition/Overview**
- Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the myocardium with variable clinical presentations, ranging from mild symptoms to severe heart failure and arrhythmias, primarily affecting individuals under 40.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Fever, malaise, fatigue
- Palpitations, chest pain
- Dyspnea, orthopnea
- Presyncope, syncope
- Signs of heart failure (e.g., S3 gallop, pulmonary rales, jugular venous distension, peripheral edema)
- Pericardial friction rub in myopericarditis

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Elevated cardiac biomarkers (troponin-I, CK-MB)
- ECG abnormalities (ST-T wave changes, PR segment depression, arrhythmias)
- Echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular dysfunction, ventricular dilatation
- Cardiac MRI findings per Lake Louise criteria (myocardial edema, LGE)
- Endomyocardial biopsy confirming inflammatory infiltrates and myocyte necrosis (Dallas criteria)

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Acute coronary syndrome
- Pericarditis
- Coronary vasospasm
- Stress cardiomyopathy
- Drug-induced myocardial injury
- Thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy
- Infective endocarditis with septic coronary emboli

**Treatment Options**
- Supportive care for heart failure (RAAS inhibitors, beta-blockers, diuretics)
- Arrhythmia management (beta-blockers, amiodarone, pacemakers)
- Immunosuppressive therapy for specific subtypes (e.g., giant cell myocarditis)
- Anticoagulation for thromboembolic prevention
- Activity restriction, especially from competitive sports for 3-6 months
- Alcohol restriction to 1 drink per day

**Critical Considerations**
- Monitor for ECG progression and complications like arrhythmias
- Consider EMB in specific scenarios (e.g., unexplained heart failure, suspected giant cell myocarditis)
- Avoid strenuous physical activity during acute phase

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Incidence approximately 6.1-22 cases per 100,000 individuals
- Viral infections most common cause; other etiologies include autoimmune diseases, hypersensitivity reactions, cardiotoxic substances
- Pathophysiology involves direct myocardial injury, immune-mediated response, and potential progression to chronic disease or resolution

**Prognosis**
- Variable; depends on disease severity and presence of complications
- 1-year mortality rate approximately 20%, increasing to 56% by 4 years
- At least 50% develop cardiomyopathy

**Complications**
- Left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure
- Cardiogenic shock
- Ventricular and atrial arrhythmias
- Thromboembolic events
- Chronic cardiomyopathy, myocardial fibrosis

**Staging**
- Stage A: At risk without symptoms or evidence of myocarditis
- Stage B: Asymptomatic with evidence of myocardial inflammation
- Stage C: Symptomatic with evidence of myocarditis
- Stage D: Advanced with hemodynamic instability or severe arrhythmias

**Deterrence and Patient Education**
- Emphasize hygiene, vaccination, and avoidance of known triggers
- Educate on symptom variability and importance of medical evaluation
- Stress adherence to treatment, activity restrictions, and lifestyle modifications
- Highlight the role of a multidisciplinary healthcare team and social support systems in recovery
