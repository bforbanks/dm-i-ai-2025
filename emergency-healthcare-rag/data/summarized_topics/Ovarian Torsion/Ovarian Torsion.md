# Ovarian Torsion

**Definition/Overview**
- Ovarian torsion is the twisting of the adnexal ligaments, leading to compromised blood flow to the ovary, a surgical emergency requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Severe, sudden lower abdominal or pelvic pain (sharp, dull, constant, or intermittent)
- Nausea and vomiting
- Possible fever, abnormal vaginal bleeding, or discharge
- Abdominal tenderness, possibly with an abdominal mass
- Symptoms of peritonitis (guarding, rigidity, rebound) in advanced cases

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Ultrasound with Doppler is the imaging study of choice; look for ovarian edema, abnormal blood flow, enlargement, free fluid, or whirlpool sign
- Laboratory tests: CBC (possible leukocytosis or anemia), CMP, serum hCG (to rule out pregnancy)
- Definitive diagnosis by direct visualization during surgery

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Ectopic pregnancy (ruled out with beta hCG)
- Ruptured ovarian cyst
- Tubo-ovarian abscess
- Appendicitis
- Pyelonephritis, diverticulitis, pelvic inflammatory disease

**Treatment Options**
- Surgical detorsion, preferably laparoscopic, performed by a gynecologist
- Evaluate ovary for viability; if salvageable, perform adnexal sparing
- If necrotic and unsalvageable, perform salpingo-oophorectomy
- Cystectomy for benign cysts; salpingo-oophorectomy for suspected malignancy or in postmenopausal women

**Critical Considerations**
- Time from symptom onset to surgery is critical for ovary salvage
- Right-sided torsion more common due to anatomical considerations
- Dual blood supply to ovary means absence of flow is not necessary for symptoms

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Most common in women of childbearing age; 2.7% of surgical emergencies in a women’s hospital over 10 years
- Risk factors: ovarian mass ≥5 cm, pregnancy, fertility treatments
- Pathophysiology involves venous congestion followed by arterial compression, leading to necrosis, infarction, hemorrhage, and potential peritonitis
