# Overdose_Poisoning

**Definition/Overview**
- MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), also known as Ecstasy, Molly, or XTC, is a synthetic amphetamine derivative with entactogenic properties that promote euphoria, memory retrieval, and enhanced sensory perception. It is classified as a Schedule I drug with a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use, although it is being studied for potential therapeutic use in PTSD.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Tachycardia
- Hypertension
- Dysrhythmias
- Anxiety
- Agitation
- Hallucinations
- Seizures
- Mydriasis
- Diaphoresis
- Hyperthermia

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Clinical presentation of sympathomimetic arousal and serotonergic effects
- Core body temperature >105 °F (40.5 °C) for hyperthermia
- Laboratory tests: BMP, LFTs, CPK levels, EKG, CBC, urinalysis, coagulation profile
- Imaging: chest radiography, CT head scan, or lumbar puncture as indicated
- Urine drug screens for amphetamines (limitations with false positives/negatives)

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Anticholinergic toxicity
- Cholinergic toxicity
- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome
- Malignant hyperthermia
- Serotonin syndrome
- Monoamine oxidase inhibitor toxicity
- Meningitis/Encephalitis
- Heatstroke/Heat exhaustion
- Rhabdomyolysis
- Amphetamine/Cocaine toxicity

**Treatment Options**
- Immediate: IV benzodiazepines for agitation (diazepam or lorazepam)
- Hyperthermia: rapid sedation and external cooling (ice-water immersion)
- Rhabdomyolysis: IV hydration to maintain urine output
- Hemodialysis for renal failure, severe acidemia, hyperkalemia
- Avoid urine acidification and dantrolene for hyperthermia

**Critical Considerations**
- Rapid life-threatening hyperthermia requires immediate cooling and sedation
- Hyponatremia due to SIADH requires careful fluid management
- Severe hepatotoxicity may lead to fulminant liver failure
- Rhabdomyolysis can cause AKI and requires aggressive hydration
- MDMA may be adulterated with other substances, complicating management

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Usage trends increased significantly in the 1990s and early 2000s
- MDMA increases norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and arginine vasopressin levels
- Metabolized hepatically via CYP2D6 with an elimination half-life of about 8 hours
- Long-term effects may include cognitive deficits and cerebrovascular system impairment

**Prognosis**
- Short-term risks include hyperthermia, arrhythmias, and hemodynamic instability
- Long-term psychiatric implications include depression, paranoia, anxiety, and insomnia
- Potential for cognitive impairment resembling dementia

**Complications**
- Neurologic: delirium, seizures
- Cardiovascular: dysrhythmias, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, intracranial hemorrhages
- Gastrointestinal: severe hepatotoxicity, fulminant liver failure
- Renal: rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure
- Endocrine: SIADH, hyponatremia
- Hyperthermia mimicking heat stroke
- Psychomotor agitation or muscle activity

**Deterrence and Patient Education**
- Educate on short- and long-term risks of MDMA use
- Highlight the potential for tolerance and the dangers of increasing doses
- Discuss long-term psychiatric effects and cognitive impairments associated with regular use
