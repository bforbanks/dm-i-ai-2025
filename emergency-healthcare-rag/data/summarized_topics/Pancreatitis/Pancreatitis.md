# Pancreatitis

**Definition/Overview**
- Acute pancreatitis is an acute inflammation of the pancreas with varying severity, while chronic pancreatitis is a progressive fibroinflammatory disease leading to irreversible pancreatic damage and dysfunction.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Acute:
  - Moderate to severe epigastric abdominal pain
  - Nausea, vomiting, anorexia
  - Fever, tachycardia, hypotension (severe cases)
  - Epigastric tenderness, guarding, rigidity
  - Grey-Turner's sign, Cullen's sign (retroperitoneal bleeding)
- Chronic:
  - Prolonged abdominal pain, intermittent pain-free periods
  - Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, steatorrhea, weight loss
  - Glucose intolerance, diabetes mellitus
  - Focal or diffuse abdominal tenderness, possible palpable mass

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Acute:
  - Lipase or amylase level ≥3 times the upper limit of normal
  - Abdominal pain consistent with pancreatitis
  - Abdominal imaging consistent with acute pancreatitis
- Chronic:
  - Clinical features, risk factors, and biomarkers consistent with chronic pancreatitis
  - Imaging: calcifications, pancreatic enlargement, ductal obstruction/dilation
  - Fecal elastase-1 level <200 µg/g indicates exocrine pancreatic insufficiency
  - Secretin-enhanced MRCP, EUS, ERCP for further evaluation

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Peptic ulcer disease, cholangitis, cholecystitis, bowel obstruction/perforation, mesenteric ischemia, acute hepatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, basilar pneumonia, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, renal colic

**Treatment Options**
- Acute:
  - Fluid resuscitation with lactated ringers solution
  - Nutritional support: early feeding in mild cases, nasojejunal feeding if severe
  - Pain management: WHO analgesic ladder, NSAIDs, opioids
  - Antibiotics for infected necrosis
  - ERCP for gallstone pancreatitis, apheresis and insulin for hypertriglyceridemia
- Chronic:
  - Alcohol and smoking cessation
  - Pain management: non-opioid medications, opioids, celiac plexus block
  - Endoscopic procedures, surgical intervention, ESWL for ductal obstruction
  - Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency

**Critical Considerations**
- Acute:
  - Monitoring for SIRS, MODS, and complications like necrosis
  - Fluid resuscitation tailored to clinical response
- Chronic:
  - Management of complications such as pseudocysts, diabetes, malnutrition
  - Risk of pancreatic cancer

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Acute:
  - Increasing incidence, mortality varies with severity (3-20%)
  - Premature activation of trypsinogen to trypsin, systemic inflammatory response
- Chronic:
  - Stable incidence, underdiagnosed prevalence
  - Progressive fibrosis, exocrine and endocrine dysfunction
  - Genetic and environmental factors, alcohol and smoking as major contributors

**Rare Presentations**
- Acute:
  - Transient ECG patterns, uncommon vessels involved in complications
- Chronic:
  - Asymptomatic for long periods, rare genetic conditions leading to chronic pancreatitis
