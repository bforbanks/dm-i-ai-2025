# Penetrating Trauma

**Definition/Overview**
- Acute acoustic trauma (AAT) is sudden sensorineural hearing loss from intense impulse noise exposure, typically exceeding 140 dB for less than 0.2 seconds.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Hearing loss
- Tinnitus
- Otalgia
- Vertigo
- Hyperacusis

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Audiometric evaluation: threshold shifts, especially at high frequencies (2-6 kHz)
- Otologic examination: tympanic membrane perforation, ossicular chain disruption
- Audiological tests: pure-tone audiometry, otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), auditory brainstem response audiometry

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Sudden sensorineural hearing loss
- Head trauma
- Stroke
- Viral infections
- Autoimmune diseases
- Chemotherapy-related ototoxicity
- Neurological disorders
- Ménière disease

**Treatment Options**
- Corticosteroids: intravenous, oral, or transtympanic
- Antioxidants and neurotrophins
- Hyperbaric oxygen therapy
- Hearing protection devices (HPDs): passive and active
- Avoid further noise exposure
- Otolaryngology referral for complications

**Critical Considerations**
- Early intervention within 24-72 hours is crucial
- Steroid treatment may improve hearing outcomes
- Avoid aminoglycoside-containing ear drops to prevent ototoxicity
- Monitor for complications like tympanic membrane perforation and facial nerve paralysis

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Prevalence: higher in military personnel, underdiagnosed in civilians
- Pathophysiology: mechanical and metabolic injuries to auditory system, cochlear inflammation, oxidative stress
- Rare presentations: high-frequency hearing loss, temporary threshold shifts, stereocilia damage
- Genetic susceptibility factors: _Ahl_ gene, CDH23, myosin 14
