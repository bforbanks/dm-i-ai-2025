# Perforated Viscus

**Definition/Overview**
- Perforated viscus refers to a peptic ulcer that has penetrated through the stomach or duodenal wall, allowing gastric contents to leak into the abdominal cavity.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Sudden, severe epigastric pain
- Pain that becomes generalized
- Symptoms of lightheadedness or syncope due to hypotension
- Abdominal distension, SIRS/sepsis if untreated
- Diffuse abdominal tenderness, guarding, rigidity on physical examination
- Tachycardia, hypotension, fever, mental status changes in advanced cases
- Positive guaiac stools on rectal examination

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- CBC, chemistry panel, liver function tests, coagulation profile, lipase levels
- Blood type and screening, blood cultures, lactic acid levels
- Urinalysis
- Imaging: Abdominal films or chest x-ray may show free air; CT scan of abdomen and pelvis is diagnostic

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Abdominal aortic aneurysm, acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, appendicitis, Boerhaave syndrome, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, choledocholithiasis, diverticulitis, duodenitis, esophagitis, foreign body ingestion, gastritis, hepatitis, hernia, mesenteric ischemia, neoplasm, nephrolithiasis, pyelonephritis, small bowel obstruction, ureterolithiasis, volvulus

**Treatment Options**
- Resuscitation with crystalloids, antibiotics, and analgesics
- Early intravenous antibiotics, especially for patients with SIRS criteria
- Nasogastric tube placement, IV proton pump inhibitors, IV antibiotics
- Surgical intervention: peritoneal lavage, sutured closure of the ulcer with an omental patch, placement of a surgical drain
- Non-operative management (Hermen-Taylor regimen) in select patients

**Critical Considerations**
- Early surgical consultation and aggressive sepsis management are crucial
- Mortality increases with surgical delay
- Antibiotics should cover gram-negative rods and anaerobes
- Intravenous PPIs are used, but efficacy in perforated ulcers is not established

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Lifetime prevalence of PUD: 5-10%, declining incidence
- Risk factors: H. pylori infection, NSAID use, advanced age
- Pathophysiology: Damage to mucosal lining by H. pylori, NSAIDs, leading to ulceration and potential perforation
- Gastric ulcers classified into four types based on location, with varying malignant potential
- Complications: Hypovolemia, shock, sepsis, gastrocolic fistula formation

**Prognosis**
- Mortality rate for perforated peptic ulcer is high, especially in patients with comorbidities, advanced age, delayed presentation, or shock on initial presentation.
