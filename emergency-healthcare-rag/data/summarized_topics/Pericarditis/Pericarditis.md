# Pericarditis

**Definition/Overview**
- Pericarditis is the inflammation of the pericardial sac surrounding the heart, classified into acute, subacute, chronic, and recurrent forms.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Central, severe, pleuritic, and positional chest pain
- Pain improvement with sitting up and leaning forward
- Pericardial friction rub on auscultation
- Dyspnea, fatigue (if myocarditis is present)
- Fever, upper respiratory symptoms (viral etiology)
- Systemic manifestations (autoimmune etiologies)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Presence of at least 2 out of 4 criteria: pericardial chest pain, pericardial rubs, new widespread ST elevation or PR depression on ECG, new or worsening pericardial effusion
- Supporting findings: elevated ESR, CRP, leukocytosis, evidence of pericardial inflammation on imaging

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Acute myocardial infarction
- Pleurisy
- Pneumonia
- Costochondritis
- Angina
- Pulmonary embolism
- Aortic dissection
- Esophageal spasm
- Peptic ulcer disease
- Acute cholecystitis

**Treatment Options**
- High-dose anti-inflammatory agents (ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen, aspirin)
- Colchicine for 3-6 months
- Corticosteroids (prednisone) if NSAIDs/ASA and colchicine are contraindicated
- Pericardiocentesis for cardiac tamponade
- Empiric anti-tuberculosis treatment for exudative effusions in endemic regions
- Pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis

**Critical Considerations**
- Monitor for ECG changes through stages I-IV
- Assess for complications like cardiac tamponade, constrictive pericarditis
- Consider underlying causes (infectious, autoimmune, traumatic, metabolic)
- Evaluate for poor prognosis markers (fever, large effusion, tamponade physiology)

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Prevalence: Common cause of chest pain, higher incidence in men
- Pathophysiology: Inflammation leads to fluid accumulation, pericardial effusion, potential progression to constrictive pericarditis
- Rare presentations: Transient, occult constrictive pericarditis, effusive-constrictive pericarditis

Constrictive Pericarditis:
- Chronic condition where granulation tissue formation results in loss of pericardial elasticity, restricting ventricular filling
- Etiology: Tuberculosis (endemic areas), idiopathic, post-viral, post-surgical, radiation therapy, connective tissue disorders
- Symptoms: Volume overload, decreased cardiac output, abdominal discomfort, ascites, hepatomegaly
- Physical Examination: Elevated JVP, Kussmaul's sign, pericardial knock, peripheral edema
- Diagnosis: Echocardiography, CT, MRI, right heart catheterization
- Management: Pericardiectomy, diuretics, anti-inflammatory agents for transient cases
- Differential Diagnosis: Cardiac tamponade, dilated cardiomyopathy, nephrotic syndrome, sarcoidosis, tricuspid regurgitation
- Complications: Pulmonary hypertension, hepatomegaly, renal failure, metabolic acidosis, hypoxia, shock, death
