# Placental Abruption

**Definition/Overview**
- Placental abruption is the premature separation of the placenta from the uterine lining before the completion of the second stage of labor, posing serious risks to maternal and fetal health.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Vaginal bleeding (visible or concealed)
- Uterine tenderness and tetanic contractions
- Maternal tachycardia and orthostatic hypotension
- Fetal distress (e.g., bradycardia, decreased variability, late decelerations)
- Shock or coagulopathy in severe cases

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Class 0: Asymptomatic, retrospective diagnosis post-delivery
- Class 1: Mild, minimal or no bleeding, slight tenderness, normal maternal vitals, no fetal distress
- Class 2: Moderate, variable bleeding, significant tenderness, maternal tachycardia, fetal distress, hypofibrinogenemia
- Class 3: Severe, possible heavy bleeding, board-like uterus, maternal shock, coagulopathy, fetal death

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Placenta previa: Painless bleeding, soft and relaxed uterus
- Uterine rupture: Severe abdominal pain, loss of fetal station, cessation of contractions
- Vasa previa: Painless bleeding, fetal bradycardia

**Treatment Options**
- Class 1: Conservative management, IV fluids, blood work, monitoring
- Class 2 & 3: Immediate delivery if fetus is viable, emergency cesarean if fetal distress, manage coagulopathy, prepare for potential hysterectomy and blood transfusions

**Critical Considerations**
- Continuous electronic fetal monitoring
- Avoid digital cervical examination until placenta previa is ruled out
- Monitor for postpartum hemorrhage and coagulopathy post-delivery
- Administer Rh (D) immune globulin if indicated by Kleihauer-Betke test

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Occurs before 37 weeks gestation, leading to maternal morbidity and perinatal mortality
- Pathophysiology involves tearing of maternal vessels from the placenta, interrupting fetal oxygen and nutrient supply
- Risk factors: Maternal age >35, hypertension, cocaine use, trauma, multiple gestations, preeclampsia
- Rare presentations include asymptomatic cases (Class 0) and varying degrees of concealed hemorrhage
