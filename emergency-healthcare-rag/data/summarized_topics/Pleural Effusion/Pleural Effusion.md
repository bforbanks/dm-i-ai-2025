# Pleural Effusion

**Definition/Overview**
- Pleural effusion is the abnormal accumulation of fluid within the pleural space, which can impair lung expansion and cause respiratory symptoms.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Shortness of breath
- Chest pain
- Cough
- Decreased breath sounds, tactile and vocal fremitus on auscultation
- Dullness on percussion
- Pleuritic pain (sharp, severe, localized pain with breathing or coughing)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- **Imaging**: Chest radiograph showing blunted costophrenic angles or meniscus sign; ultrasound can detect as little as 50 mL of fluid.
- **Thoracentesis**: Diagnostic and therapeutic; fluid analysis using Light's criteria (exudate if pleural fluid protein/serum protein ratio >0.5, pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH ratio >0.6, or pleural fluid LDH > two-thirds the upper limit of normal serum LDH).
- **Heffner's criteria**: Exudate if pleural fluid protein >2.9 g/dL, cholesterol >45 mg/dL, or LDH > two-thirds the upper limit of normal serum LDH.

**Differential Diagnosis**
- **Transudative**: Congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, cirrhosis, peritoneal dialysis, nephrotic syndrome, hypoalbuminemia.
- **Exudative**: Infections (bacterial, tuberculosis, viral, fungal, parasitic), neoplasm (primary lung cancer, metastatic disease, mesothelioma), pancreatitis, autoimmune conditions, drug-induced, post-operative (chylothorax, hemothorax).

**Treatment Options**
- Treat underlying cause.
- Drainage via thoracentesis for symptomatic relief or diagnostic purposes.
- Chest tube drainage with antibiotics for complex parapneumonic effusions or empyema.
- Pleurodesis or tunneled catheter placement for recurrent malignant effusions.
- Limit fluid extraction to â‰¤1500 mL to prevent reexpansion pulmonary edema.

**Critical Considerations**
- Monitor for complications such as empyema or pleural thickening.
- Consider pleural elastance measurements for trapped lung.
- Pleural fluid analysis critical for distinguishing between transudative and exudative effusions.

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Affects approximately 1.5 million patients annually in the U.S.
- Pathophysiology involves imbalance in fluid production and reabsorption due to increased capillary pressure, increased capillary permeability, decreased intrapleural pressure, decreased plasma oncotic pressure, or obstruction of pleural lymphatic drainage.
