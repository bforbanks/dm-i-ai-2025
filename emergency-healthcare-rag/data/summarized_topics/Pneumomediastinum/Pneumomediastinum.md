# Pneumomediastinum

**Definition/Overview**
- Pneumomediastinum, also known as mediastinal emphysema, is the presence of air in the mediastinum, which can extend into surrounding tissues.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Retrosternal chest pain, often radiating to the neck or back
- Dyspnea
- Coughing spells
- Neck pain
- Odynophagia
- Dysphagia
- Emesis
- Abdominal pain
- Subcutaneous emphysema
- Hamman sign (mediastinal crunch)
- Rhinolalia
- Dysphonia
- Hoarseness
- Neck swelling
- Tachycardia
- Tachypnea

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Chest X-ray findings: air outlining mediastinal structures, subcutaneous emphysema, elevation of the thymus (spinnaker sign), ring sign, hyperlucent V shape, double bronchial wall, continuous diaphragm sign, pleural effusion
- CT scan: definitive for pneumomediastinum, differentiates from pneumopericardium
- Ultrasound: "air gap sign," air adjacent to heart or diaphragm, subcutaneous hyperechoic foci

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Acute coronary syndrome
- Pericarditis
- Myocarditis
- Pneumopericardium
- Pleuritis
- Pulmonary embolism
- Pneumothorax
- Pneumonia
- Traumatic tracheal rupture
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease
- Pancreatitis
- Esophageal rupture
- Costochondritis
- Sternal and rib contusions
- Rib fractures
- Malignancy
- Sickle cell crisis

**Treatment Options**
- Symptomatic management: bed rest, oxygen, antitussives, analgesia
- Prophylactic antibiotics for aerodigestive injury
- Outpatient follow-up or brief inpatient observation
- Hospital admission for distress, febrile patients, or secondary pneumomediastinum
- Contrast swallow study for emesis, dysphagia, traumatic injuries, hemodynamic instability, pleural effusion, signs of infection, or pneumoperitoneum
- Surgical decompression for extensive subcutaneous emphysema
- Chest tube placement for pneumothorax
- Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or thoracotomy for malignant pneumomediastinum

**Critical Considerations**
- Monitor for ECG progression and complications such as tension pneumomediastinum, which can cause hypotension and hypoxemia
- Consider malignancy in differential diagnosis
- Assess for signs of infection or pneumoperitoneum

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Prevalence: 0.002%, higher in young males with low BMI
- Pathophysiology: Macklin phenomenon (alveolar rupture, air dissection into peribronchial and perivascular sheaths, spread to mediastinum)
- Risk factors: smoking, drug inhalation, asthma, COPD, trauma, iatrogenic causes
- Rare presentations: malignant pneumomediastinum, extensive subcutaneous emphysema
