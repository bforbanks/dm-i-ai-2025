# Pneumonia (bacterial_viral_atypical)

**Definition/Overview**
- Viral pneumonia is an inflammation of the alveoli in the lungs due to viral infection, affecting gas exchange.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Gradual onset of symptoms
- Low-grade fever
- Non-purulent sputum
- Upper respiratory tract infection symptoms
- Rash
- Tachycardia or tachypnea
- Bilateral lung infiltrates

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- CBC: variable WBC count
- Chemistry panel: assesses dehydration and organ function
- C-reactive protein: may be elevated
- ELISA and rapid antigen tests: detect specific viruses
- PCR testing: identifies viral genetic material
- Chest x-ray: interstitial infiltrates, bilateral infiltrates
- Chest CT scan: may show parenchymal defects

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Bacterial pneumonia
- Bronchitis
- Fungal pneumonia
- Non-infectious lung diseases

**Treatment Options**
- Supportive care: oxygen, hydration, rest, nutrition
- Antiviral medications: specific to the viral etiology (e.g., oseltamivir for influenza)
- Management of comorbid illnesses
- Consideration of bacterial co-infection

**Critical Considerations**
- Immune status of the patient
- Presence of comorbid conditions
- Early identification and treatment
- Monitoring for complications such as ARDS, respiratory failure, and sepsis

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Common in young children, elderly, and immunocompromised
- Viral entry via direct inoculation, contiguous spread, or hematogenous route
- Inflammatory response in alveoli leading to edema and impaired gas exchange

**Prevention & Patient Education**
- Vaccination against influenza, measles, and varicella
- Education on prophylaxis post-exposure
- HIV prevention and management
- Awareness for immunosuppressed individuals
