# Pneumothorax

**Definition/Overview**
- Pneumothorax is the presence of air or gas in the pleural space, which can disrupt lung expansion and impair ventilation and oxygenation.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Sudden, unilateral chest pain
- Shortness of breath
- Decreased breath sounds on affected side
- Hyperresonance on percussion
- Tachycardia, hypotension, jugular venous distention (tension pneumothorax)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Chest X-ray: visible rim of air between lung margin and chest wall
- Ultrasound: absence of lung sliding, presence of lung point
- CT scan: for occult pneumothoraces or detailed assessment
- Arterial blood gas analysis: may show hypoxia or hypercapnia

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Pulmonary: pneumonia, asthma, pulmonary embolism, tuberculosis
- Cardiovascular: aortic dissection, acute coronary syndrome
- Gastrointestinal: GERD, esophageal rupture
- Musculoskeletal: rib fracture, costochondritis
- Psychiatric: panic attack

**Treatment Options**
- Needle decompression for tension pneumothorax
- Thoracostomy tube placement for large or symptomatic pneumothoraces
- Observation and oxygen therapy for small, asymptomatic pneumothoraces
- Surgical intervention (VATS or thoracotomy) for recurrent or persistent pneumothoraces

**Critical Considerations**
- Immediate needle decompression for tension pneumothorax
- Avoid positive pressure ventilation in untreated pneumothorax
- Monitor for complications such as reexpansion pulmonary edema

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Incidence: 7-18 per 100,000 annually; higher in smokers
- Primary spontaneous pneumothorax: typically in young, tall, thin males without lung disease
- Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax: associated with underlying lung conditions
- Iatrogenic and traumatic pneumothorax: due to medical procedures or chest trauma
- Tension pneumothorax: life-threatening, requires immediate intervention

**Rare Presentations**
- Catamenial pneumothorax: associated with menstruation
- Bilateral pneumothorax: may occur congenitally or iatrogenically
- Pneumomediastinum: air in the mediastinum, may accompany pneumothorax

**Contraindications & Warnings**
- Avoid air travel or diving until pneumothorax is resolved
- Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation contraindicated in untreated pneumothorax
- Caution with needle decompression to avoid injury to neurovascular bundle

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- PSP incidence: 7 per 100,000 men, 1 per 100,000 women annually
- SSP incidence: 6.3 per 100,000 men, 2 per 100,000 women annually
- Pathophysiology involves changes in intrathoracic pressure gradients leading to lung collapse

**Rare Presentations**
- Catamenial pneumothorax: occurs in women, related to menstruation
- Bilateral pneumothorax: may be congenital or iatrogenic
- Pneumomediastinum: air in mediastinum, may accompany pneumothorax
