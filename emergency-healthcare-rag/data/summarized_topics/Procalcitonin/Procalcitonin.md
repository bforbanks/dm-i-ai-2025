# Procalcitonin

**Definition/Overview**
- Procalcitonin is a peptide hormone primarily synthesized by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland, used in the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis, Paget disease of bone, and hypercalcemia.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Postmenopausal osteoporosis: Decreased bone mineral density, increased risk of fractures
- Paget disease of bone: Bone pain, neurological deficits, hearing loss
- Hypercalcemia: Confusion, coma, dehydration, polyuria, kidney stones, nausea, constipation, pancreatitis, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Postmenopausal osteoporosis: Diagnosis based on bone mineral density (BMD) measurements
- Paget disease of bone: Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), urine hydroxyproline, radiographic and symptomatic evidence
- Hypercalcemia: Serum calcium levels >10.4 mg/dL

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Osteoporosis: Differentiate from other metabolic bone diseases
- Paget disease of bone: Differentiate from osteoarthritis, metastatic bone disease, primary hyperparathyroidism
- Hypercalcemia: Differentiate from primary hyperparathyroidism, malignancy, vitamin D intoxication

**Treatment Options**
- Postmenopausal osteoporosis: 200 IU intranasal or 100 IU IM/SQ daily, with calcium and vitamin D supplementation
- Paget disease of bone: 50-100 IU IM/SQ daily or every 1-3 days, with calcium and vitamin D supplementation
- Hypercalcemia: 4-8 IU/kg IM/SQ every 6-12 hours, with rehydration and bisphosphonates

**Critical Considerations**
- Osteoclast activity adaptation reduces calcitonin efficacy over time
- Monitor for hypersensitivity reactions, especially in fish-allergic patients
- Monitor serum calcium levels to prevent hypocalcemia

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Calcitonin inhibits osteoclast activity and increases renal excretion of calcium, reducing bone resorption and serum calcium levels
- Salmon calcitonin is more potent than human calcitonin
- Long-term use may lead to antibody formation, reducing effectiveness

**Contraindications**
- Known hypersensitivity to calcitonin or its components
- Caution in patients with bipolar disorder due to potential lowering of serum lithium levels

**Monitoring**
- Bone mineral density, serum calcium, serum calcifediol, height, weight, and biochemical markers of bone turnover
- Serum ALP for Paget disease of bone
- Hypersensitivity reactions and hypocalcemia

**Toxicity**
- Possible association with increased cancer incidence, particularly basal cell carcinoma
- Risk of hypocalcemia with symptoms ranging from tetany to cardiac arrest
