# Pulmonary Embolism

**Definition/Overview**
- Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by a blood clot obstructing the pulmonary arteries, often originating from a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremities.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Dyspnea
- Chest pain
- Cough
- Syncope
- Hemodynamic instability
- Signs of right ventricular strain

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Clinical probability scoring: Wells and Geneva criteria
- D-dimer levels: negative D-dimer rules out PE in low-probability patients
- CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA): modality of choice, high sensitivity and specificity
- Echocardiography: may show right ventricular strain
- Compression ultrasonography: for detecting DVT
- Pulmonary angiography: rarely used, previously gold standard
- V/Q scan: for patients with contraindications to CTPA
- ECG: nonspecific findings, may show signs of right heart strain
- ABG analysis: hypoxemia, widened A-a gradient, respiratory alkalosis

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Acute coronary syndrome
- Congestive heart failure
- Pneumonia
- Pneumothorax
- Cardiac arrhythmias

**Treatment Options**
- Anticoagulation: LMWH, fondaparinux, UFH, NOACs, VKA
- Thrombolysis: for hemodynamically unstable patients
- Catheter-directed therapy: for hemodynamically unstable patients or those with contraindications to thrombolysis
- Surgical embolectomy: if thrombolysis is contraindicated or has failed
- Vena cava filters: for contraindications to anticoagulation or recurrent VTE despite anticoagulation

**Critical Considerations**
- Hemodynamic instability indicates high risk of mortality
- Right ventricular failure is a primary cause of death
- Thrombolysis increases risk of bleeding, especially intracranial hemorrhage
- Long-term anticoagulation tailored to individual risk factors

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Incidence: 39 to 115 per 100,000 annually for PE
- Pathophysiology: obstruction of pulmonary vascular bed, impaired gas exchange, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, right ventricular strain, and potential infarction

**Contraindications**
- Absolute contraindications to thrombolysis include recent intracranial hemorrhage, structural cerebrovascular disease, recent ischemic stroke, suspected aortic dissection, active bleeding, recent major surgery, and significant closed-head or facial trauma.
