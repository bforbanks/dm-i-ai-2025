# Pulmonary Fibrosis

**Definition/Overview**
- Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disorder characterized by unknown cause scarring, with a poor prognosis.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Gradual onset of shortness of breath
- Progressive dyspnea
- Dry, nonproductive cough
- Fine bibasilar “velcro” crackles
- Digital clubbing (in some cases)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Restrictive lung function impairment on PFTs: decreased FVC, TLC, and DLCO
- HRCT showing UIP pattern: subpleural basal predominant honeycombing, traction bronchiectasis
- Exclusion of other known causes of ILD
- Lung biopsy may be required if diagnostic uncertainty persists, showing UIP pattern histologically

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Occupational lung diseases (pneumoconiosis, asbestosis)
- Aspiration pneumonitis
- Bacterial and viral pneumonia
- Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
- Fungal infection
- Lung cancer
- _Pneumocystis jiroveci_ pneumonia
- Sarcoidosis
- Pulmonary edema
- Connective tissue diseases

**Treatment Options**
- Supportive: oxygen supplementation, pulmonary rehabilitation
- Antifibrotic medications: pirfenidone (up to 2403 mg/day), nintedanib (300 mg/day)
- Lung transplantation for severe cases
- Palliative care in end-stage disease
- Vaccinations: influenza, pneumococcus, COVID-19

**Critical Considerations**
- Early diagnosis is crucial for slowing progression
- Monitor for acute exacerbations, pulmonary hypertension, and comorbidities
- Avoid lung biopsy in patients with a classic UIP pattern on HRCT
- Consider lung transplant referral early

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Prevalence increases with age, more common in males
- Pathogenesis involves alveolar epithelial injury, abnormal fibroblast activation, and immune response
- Genetic mutations (_TERT_, _SFTPA2_, _MUC5B_) implicated in familial cases
- Associated with smoking, environmental exposures, and possibly thyroid dysfunction

**Complications**
- Pulmonary hypertension
- Thromboembolic disease
- Lung infections
- Acute coronary syndrome
- Hypoxic respiratory failure

**Deterrence and Patient Education**
- Regular exercise, smoking cessation, managing GERD
- Avoid harmful environmental exposures
- Follow up for disease-specific therapies
- Consider lung transplant referral
- Vaccinations for respiratory infections
