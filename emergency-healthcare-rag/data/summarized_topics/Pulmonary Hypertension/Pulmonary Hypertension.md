# Pulmonary Hypertension

**Definition/Overview**
- Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is a condition characterized by elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, with High Altitude Pulmonary Hypertension (HAPH) being a subset occurring in individuals residing at altitudes greater than 2500 meters.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Exertional dyspnea
- Cough
- Hemoptysis
- Chest tightness
- Fatigue
- Lower extremity swelling
- Syncope
- Signs of right-sided heart failure (loud P2, right ventricular heave, tricuspid regurgitation, jugular venous distension, peripheral edema, ascites)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) â‰¥ 25 mmHg via right heart catheterization
- Residence at elevation > 2500 meters
- EKG: right ventricular hypertrophy, right bundle branch block, tall P-waves in inferior leads
- Echocardiogram: dilated right ventricle and atrium, increased pulmonary artery pressure
- Chest X-ray: may show cardiomegaly or pulmonary vascular congestion
- Pulmonary function tests: exclude other lung diseases
- Right-sided heart catheterization: mPAP > 30 mmHg or systolic PAP > 50 mmHg diagnostic for PH

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Asthma
- Congenital heart disease
- Connective tissue disease
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
- Diastolic dysfunction
- Interstitial lung disease
- Systolic dysfunction

**Treatment Options**
- Advised relocation to lower altitudes
- Pharmacological treatments:
  - Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g., Sildenafil)
  - Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors (e.g., Acetazolamide)
  - Endothelin receptor blockers (e.g., Bosentan)
- Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe cases
- Pulmonary transplantation for irreversible PH

**Critical Considerations**
- ECG progression indicative of chronic right heart strain
- Complications include exercise intolerance, right ventricular failure, and death
- Pulmonary artery pressures may normalize after descent to lower altitudes

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Prevalence: 18-55% in high-altitude South American populations, more common in men
- Pathophysiology involves hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction, vascular remodeling, and decreased nitric oxide synthesis
- Genetic predisposition and individual response to hypoxia contribute to disease development
- Chronic hypoxia leads to irreversible changes in pulmonary vasculature
