# Pulse Oximetry_Arterial Saturation

**Definition/Overview**
Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive method to measure arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), while capnography monitors the concentration or partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CO2) in respiratory gases.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Cyanosis
- Shortness of breath
- Decreased exercise tolerance
- Altered mental status

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- SpO2 < 92% may indicate underlying lung disease
- SpO2 â‰¤ 88% in chronic conditions like COPD qualifies for oxygen therapy
- End-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) of 35 to 45 mm Hg is normal; deviations may indicate hypoventilation or hyperventilation

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Respiratory failure
- Carbon monoxide poisoning (falsely high SpO2 readings)
- Methemoglobinemia (falsely low SpO2 readings)
- Anemia
- Circulatory shock

**Treatment Options**
- Oxygen therapy titrated to maintain SpO2 between 88% to 92% in chronic lung diseases
- Advanced airway management and mechanical ventilation in cases of respiratory failure
- Specific antidotes in cases of poisoning affecting oxygenation (e.g., methylene blue for methemoglobinemia)

**Critical Considerations**
- Pulse oximetry may overestimate oxygen saturation in the presence of carboxyhemoglobin or methemoglobin
- Capnography provides early detection of hypoventilation, apnea, or airway obstruction
- Pulse oximetry does not provide real-time assessment of alveolar ventilation

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Hypoxemia can result from diffusion limitation, hypoventilation, decreased FiO2, low ventilation-perfusion quotient, or shunt
- Oxygen is primarily carried by hemoglobin; the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve is sigmoidal due to cooperative binding
- The A-a gradient helps distinguish pathogenic causes of hypoxemia
- CO2 transport involves dissolution in plasma, buffering with water as carbonic acid, or binding to hemoglobin
- The Haldane effect describes how oxygen binding to hemoglobin promotes the release of CO2
- Alveolar ventilation is physiologically controlled by respiratory rate and tidal volume; deviations can lead to hypoventilation or hyperventilation
