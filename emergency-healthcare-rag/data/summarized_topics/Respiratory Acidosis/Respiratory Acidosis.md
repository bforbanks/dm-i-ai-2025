# Respiratory Acidosis

**Definition/Overview**
- Respiratory acidosis is a condition characterized by an elevated arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) and a decreased blood pH due to alveolar hypoventilation.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Dyspnea
- Anxiety
- Wheezing
- Sleep disturbances
- Cyanosis (in cases of hypoxemia)
- Altered mental status
- Myoclonus
- Seizures (in severe cases)
- Daytime somnolence
- Headaches
- Memory loss, impaired coordination (chronic cases)
- Polycythemia, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure (chronic cases)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Arterial blood gas (ABG) showing:
  - Elevated pCO2 (>45 mmHg)
  - Elevated bicarbonate (HCO3-) (>30 mmHg)
  - Decreased pH (<7.35)
- Classification based on HCO3- increase relative to pCO2:
  - Acute: HCO3- increases by 1 mEq/L for every 10 mmHg increase in pCO2
  - Chronic: HCO3- increases by 4 mEq/L for every 10 mmHg increase in pCO2

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Botulism
- Bronchitis
- Diaphragm disorders
- Diaphragmatic paralysis
- Asthma
- Opioid use
- Sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic use disorder
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
- Obesity (Pickwickian syndrome)

**Treatment Options**
- Address underlying cause of hypoventilation
- Gradual correction of hypercapnia to avoid rapid CSF alkalization
- Pharmacologic therapy:
  - Bronchodilators (beta-agonists, anticholinergic drugs, methylxanthines)
  - Naloxone for opioid overdose

**Critical Considerations**
- Rapid correction of hypercapnia may lead to seizures
- Mixed respiratory-metabolic disorders if compensation does not follow expected patterns
- Increased intracranial pressure and risk of herniation in severe cases

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Varies based on etiology; common in end-stage COPD and surgical patients
- Mechanism: hypoventilation leads to CO2 retention, increased H+ ions, and decreased pH
- Renal compensation by excreting acid and reabsorbing bicarbonate
- Chronic cases show renal compensation over days
- Rare presentations include slight elevations in ionized calcium and extracellular shift of potassium
