# Respiratory Failure

**Definition/Overview**
- Respiratory failure is the inability of the respiratory system to provide adequate oxygenation or remove carbon dioxide, leading to hypoxemia (Type 1) or hypercapnia (Type 2).

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Dyspnea
- Cough
- Hemoptysis
- Sputum production
- Wheezing
- Accessory muscle use
- Altered mental status
- Cyanosis
- Tachypnea or bradypnea
- Crackles, wheezes, or decreased breath sounds on auscultation

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Type 1: PaO2 < 60 mmHg with normal or decreased PaCO2
- Type 2: PaCO2 > 45 mmHg with pH < 7.35
- ABG analysis, capnometry, pulse oximetry, chest imaging, and ultrasonography are key diagnostic tools.

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
- Pneumonia
- Asthma
- COPD exacerbation
- Pulmonary embolism
- Cardiogenic pulmonary edema
- Pleural effusion
- Obstructive sleep apnea

**Treatment Options**
- Oxygen therapy to maintain SpO2 90-94%
- Mechanical ventilation for severe cases
- Treat underlying cause
- Noninvasive ventilation preferred in COPD exacerbation, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, obesity hypoventilation syndrome

**Critical Considerations**
- Avoid oxygen toxicity and CO2 narcosis
- Monitor for complications such as nosocomial pneumonia, pneumothorax, and ventilator-associated lung injury
- Consider noninvasive ventilation when appropriate

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Incidence in the US: 1,275 cases per 100,000 adults in 2017
- Type 1 caused by alveolar hypoventilation, low atmospheric pressure/FiO2, diffusion defect, V/Q mismatch, right-to-left shunt
- Type 2 caused by respiratory pump failure, increased CO2 production, alveolar hypoventilation, increased dead space, or increased CO production
