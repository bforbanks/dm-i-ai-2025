# Rhabdomyolysis

**Definition/Overview**
- Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical syndrome resulting from the breakdown of skeletal muscle fibers with leakage of muscle contents into the circulation, leading to complications such as acute kidney injury (AKI), electrolyte imbalances, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Muscle weakness
- Muscle pain (myalgias)
- Local swelling
- Dark reddish urine (myoglobinuria)
- Possible systemic symptoms: malaise, fever, nausea, confusion, agitation

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels elevated, typically 5x upper limit of normal (100-400 U/L), but no specific diagnostic threshold
- Myoglobinuria indicated by dark urine, positive on dipstick for blood in the absence of red blood cells
- Possible electrolyte imbalances: hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia
- ECG changes due to electrolyte disturbances
- Muscle biopsy indicated for suspected inherited myopathies

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Compartment syndrome
- Electrolyte disorders
- Infections (e.g., viral, bacterial)
- Endocrine disorders (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis)
- Toxins (e.g., drugs, poisons)
- Inherited myopathies (e.g., Duchenne muscular dystrophy)

**Treatment Options**
- Immediate IV hydration to prevent AKI, with isotonic saline
- Urine alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate to prevent myoglobin precipitation
- Mannitol to promote diuresis (if urine output adequate)
- Monitoring and correction of electrolyte imbalances
- Dialysis for severe AKI, hyperkalemia, or volume overload
- Treat underlying causes (e.g., discontinue offending drugs, manage infections)

**Critical Considerations**
- Rapid progression to AKI
- Compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy
- DIC with coagulopathy
- Electrolyte management, especially hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia
- Avoidance of potassium-containing IV fluids

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Approximately 26,000 cases/year in the U.S.
- Pathophysiology involves muscle cell injury, ATP depletion, electrolyte shifts, and inflammatory response
- Myoglobinuria leading to AKI
- Risk factors: trauma, immobilization, extreme exertion, drugs (e.g., statins), infections, genetic predispositions
