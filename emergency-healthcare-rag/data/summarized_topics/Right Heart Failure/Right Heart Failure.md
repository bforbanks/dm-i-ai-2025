# Right Heart Failure

**Definition/Overview**
Right heart failure, often secondary to pulmonary hypertension, is a condition where the right ventricle is unable to pump blood effectively through the pulmonary circulation, leading to systemic venous congestion and reduced cardiac output.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Generalized fatigue
- Angina
- Near syncope and syncopal episodes
- Distended neck veins
- Tricuspid regurgitation
- S3 gallop
- Hepatomegaly
- Abdominal ascites
- Peripheral edema
- Dyspnea at rest
- Hypoxemia

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Mean pulmonary artery pressure â‰¥ 25 mm Hg at rest, diagnosed by right heart catheterization
- ECG: may show signs of right ventricular hypertrophy
- Echocardiogram: right ventricular dysfunction, tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension
- Chest radiograph: may show enlarged pulmonary arteries, right ventricular enlargement
- Labs: Hemoglobin, hematocrit, comprehensive metabolic panel
- Consider pulmonary function testing and arterial blood gas analysis

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Left heart failure
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
- Pulmonary embolism
- Valvular heart disease
- Congenital heart disease

**Treatment Options**
- Preoperative optimization to lower pulmonary vascular resistance and improve right ventricular function
- Intraoperative monitoring with pulse oximetry, ECG, blood pressure, temperature, arterial catheter, central venous catheter, pulmonary artery catheter, and TEE
- Induction with etomidate, avoiding spinal anesthesia
- Ventilation with low tidal volumes (6 ml/kg), peak airway pressures < 30 mm Hg, PEEP 5-10 cm water
- Pharmacologic therapies: prostanoids (e.g., epoprostenol), endothelin receptor antagonists, nitric oxide, phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil)
- Fluid management, afterload reduction, inotropic support (e.g., norepinephrine)
- Vasoconstrictors for systemic hypotension (e.g., vasopressin, phenylephrine)
- Management of arrhythmias with cardioversion, ablation, or medications (e.g., amiodarone, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers)

**Critical Considerations**
- Avoid exacerbating factors such as hypercapnia, hypoxia, or acidemia
- Manage acute right heart failure with fluid administration, afterload reduction, and inotropic agents
- Aggressive treatment of systemic hypotension with vasoconstrictors
- Avoid one-lung ventilation and high levels of PEEP
- Monitor for and treat arrhythmias promptly

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Pulmonary hypertension is a progressive disease with delayed diagnosis and treatment
- Caused by vascular proliferation, arteriolar vasoconstriction, elevated pulmonary venous pressure, and in-situ thrombosis
- Leads to increased right ventricular afterload, hypertrophy, and dysfunction
- Increased morbidity and mortality associated with anesthesia and surgery due to potential complications
