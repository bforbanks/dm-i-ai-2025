# Ruptured AAA

**Definition/Overview**
- Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture is a life-threatening condition characterized by abnormal focal dilation of the abdominal aorta, enlarging by at least 150% compared to the normal adjacent artery diameter.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Diffuse abdominal pain and distension
- Shock
- Nontender, pulsatile abdominal mass (if unruptured)
- Abdominal, flank, or back pain (if enlarging)
- Gastrointestinal or renal manifestations due to compression of adjacent viscera
- Tenderness over the aneurysm
- Signs of embolization

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Ultrasound: initial screening and monitoring tool
- CT angiography: preferred for symptomatic individuals, exact size, and vessel involvement
- Magnetic resonance angiography: alternative for patients with contrast allergies
- Blood work including cross-match for surgery
- Echocardiogram for associated heart disease

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Mesenteric ischemia
- Peptic ulcer disease
- Diverticulitis
- Pyelonephritis
- Myocardial infarction
- Ureteric colic

**Treatment Options**
- Unruptured AAA: repair recommended at 5.5 cm in men, 5.0 cm in women, or rapid enlargement (>0.5 cm over 6 months)
- Ruptured AAA: emergency repair
- Endovascular repair (EVAR): preferred for suitable anatomy and high-risk patients
- Open surgical repair: transabdominal or retroperitoneal approach
- Surveillance imaging for AAAs 4.0-4.9 cm in diameter
- Cardiovascular risk factor modification
- Smoking cessation, blood pressure control, statin, antiplatelet therapy

**Critical Considerations**
- Mortality rates remain high for ruptured AAA
- Proximal control is crucial in ruptured AAA
- EVAR device failure due to continued aortic neck expansion
- Open repair: intensive care monitoring postoperatively
- EVAR: periodic follow-up with ultrasound or CT scan

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Prevalence: 1.4% in individuals aged 50 to 84
- Highest risk in White men, advanced age, smokers
- Reduced risk in non-White races and diabetics
- Pathophysiology: failure of structural proteins, chronic inflammation, genetic factors
- Enlargement rate: 0.2-0.3 cm/year for small AAAs, 0.3-0.5 cm/year for >5 cm diameter

**Guidelines on Management of abdominal aortic aneurysms**
- Yearly surveillance imaging for AAAs 4.0-4.9 cm
- Preoperative 12-lead ECG within 4 weeks of elective surgery
- Delay open surgery for at least 6 months post-drug-eluting stent placement
- Smoking cessation advised at least 2 weeks before AAA repair
- Transfusion if hemoglobin <7 g/dL
- Endovascular repair preferred for suitable anatomy and life expectancy
- Door-to-intervention time <90 minutes for ruptured AAA
- Multimodal pain management postoperatively
- Postoperative surveillance with color duplex ultrasonography or CT scan
- Treatment of types I, III, and expanding type II endoleaks
- Antibiotic prophylaxis for aortic graft infection prevention before certain procedures
- Endovascular procedures in hospitals with at least 10 cases yearly and <2% conversion rate
- Open surgery in hospitals with <5% mortality and at least 10 open cases annually
