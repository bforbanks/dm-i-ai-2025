# Seizures_Status Epilepticus

**Definition/Overview**
- Electrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES) is an epileptic encephalopathy with cognitive regression and significant epileptiform activity during non-rapid eye movement sleep, resulting in continuous spike-wave discharges on EEG.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Infrequent seizures (focal or generalized)
- Stagnation or regression in developmental progress
- Behavioral abnormalities, particularly hyperactivity

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Bilateral continuous or near-continuous spike-wave discharges during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep
- Spike-wave index thresholds commonly accepted for diagnosis: 85% or 50%
- Intermittent focal or multifocal epileptiform discharges during wakefulness

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Landau-Kleffner syndrome
- Benign pediatric focal epileptic syndromes
- Lennox-Gastaut syndrome

**Treatment Options**
- Traditional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs): valproate, ethosuximide, levetiracetam
- Benzodiazepines: diazepam, clobazam
- Corticosteroids: methylprednisolone, prednisolone, adrenocorticotropic hormone
- Epilepsy surgery for structural brain pathology
- Nonpharmacologic therapies: ketogenic diet, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)

**Critical Considerations**
- Avoid AEDs that can worsen seizures (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine)
- Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial to prevent long-term cognitive decline
- EEG abnormalities may spontaneously improve after puberty, but cognitive deficits may persist

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Rare condition, prevalence of 0.2% among patients with epilepsy
- Typically affects children between 2 and 12 years, peak incidence between 3 and 5 years
- Associated with various etiologies, including genetic mutations and structural brain abnormalities
- Pathophysiology involves abnormal hyperactivation of the thalamic oscillatory circuit

**Prognosis**
- Clinical seizures and EEG abnormalities may improve after puberty
- Cognitive impairment may only partially reverse, depending on the duration of ESES and treatment efficacy

**Complications**
- Persistent cognitive impairment if treatment is inadequate or diagnosis is delayed
