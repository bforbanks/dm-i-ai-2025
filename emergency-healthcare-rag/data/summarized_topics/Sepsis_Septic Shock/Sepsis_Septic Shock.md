# Sepsis_Septic Shock

**Definition/Overview**
- Urosepsis is a severe infection that arises from the urinary tract, leading to a systemic inflammatory response known as sepsis, which can progress to septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Dysuria
- Urinary frequency and urgency
- Suprapubic pain
- Hematuria
- Fever, chills
- Flank pain
- Costovertebral angle tenderness
- Nausea/vomiting
- Altered mental status
- Hypotension

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Clinical diagnosis based on signs and symptoms of UTI and systemic infection
- Laboratory findings: leukocytosis or leukopenia, elevated C-reactive protein or procalcitonin, positive blood and urine cultures
- Imaging: Ultrasound or CT scan may show hydronephrosis or abscess

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Urinary tract infection
- Cystitis
- Pyelonephritis
- Acute bacterial prostatitis
- Prostatic abscess
- Renal abscess
- Urolithiasis

**Treatment Options**
- Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics within one hour of diagnosis
- Fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (minimum 30 mL/kg)
- Vasopressor support to maintain mean arterial pressure >65 mm Hg
- Source control measures (e.g., Foley catheter, stent placement)

**Critical Considerations**
- Early identification and treatment are crucial
- Monitor for signs of septic shock and organ dysfunction
- Adjust antibiotic therapy based on culture results and local susceptibility patterns
- Manage complicating factors in the urinary tract promptly

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Common pathogens: _Escherichia coli_, _Proteus_, _Enterobacter_, _Klebsiella_, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_
- Pathophysiology involves host immune response to bacterial pathogens, leading to inflammation, cell necrosis, and potential immunosuppression
- Mortality rate from urosepsis is 30% to 40%

**Prognosis**
- Treatable if managed promptly
- Delayed treatment can lead to renal failure, septic shock, and death

**Complications**
- Renal failure
- Septic shock
- Death

**Deterrence and Patient Education**
- Prompt care for UTI symptoms
- Importance of medication adherence
