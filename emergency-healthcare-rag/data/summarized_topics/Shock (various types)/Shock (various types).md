# Shock (various types)

**Definition/Overview**
- Cardiogenic shock is a low cardiac output state resulting in end-organ hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia, primarily caused by cardiac disorders.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mm Hg for ≥ 30 minutes or vasopressor support required
- Urine output ≤ 30 mL/hr
- Cool extremities
- Altered mental status
- Oliguria
- Cyanosis
- Cold, clammy skin
- Mottled extremities
- Faint peripheral pulses
- Jugular venous distension
- Diminished heart sounds, possible S3 or S4
- Murmurs (mitral regurgitation or aortic stenosis)
- Rales due to pulmonary congestion
- Peripheral edema

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mm Hg for ≥ 30 minutes or vasopressor support
- Urine output ≤ 30 mL/hr
- Cardiac index ≤ 2.2 L/min/m²
- Pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure > 15 mm Hg
- Elevated lactate levels
- Elevated cardiac enzymes
- ECG changes indicative of ischemia or infarction
- Echocardiographic evidence of ventricular dysfunction

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Septic shock
- Hemorrhagic shock
- Neurogenic shock

**Treatment Options**
- **Pharmacological Therapy:**
  - Norepinephrine for severe hypotension
  - Dobutamine to improve myocardial contractility
  - Milrinone to reduce left ventricular filling pressures
  - Fibrinolytic therapy if PCI or CABG not possible
  - Aspirin and heparin for myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome
  - Diuretics like furosemide for fluid overload
  - Therapeutic hypothermia for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with shockable rhythm
- **Procedures:**
  - Central line placement for fluid resuscitation and monitoring
  - Arterial line placement for continuous blood pressure monitoring
  - Mechanical ventilation for respiratory support
- **Revascularization:**
  - Primary PCI or urgent CABG
- **Mechanical Circulatory Support:**
  - Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP)
  - Percutaneous circulatory assist devices
  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
  - Ventricular assist devices (VADs)
  - Cardiac transplantation in selected patients

**Critical Considerations**
- Early revascularization is critical
- Monitoring for ECG progression and complications
- Avoidance of beta-blockers initially
- Consideration of MCS in refractory cases

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Incidence declining due to increased use of PCI
- 5-8% of STEMI and 2-3% of NSTEMI cases result in cardiogenic shock
- Higher incidence in elderly, diabetics, previous left ventricular injury, and females
- Pathophysiology involves myocardial ischemia leading to reduced contractility, compensatory mechanisms like sympathetic activation and tachycardia, and pathologic vasodilation due to inflammatory markers, resulting in a cycle of hypoperfusion and multiorgan failure.
