# Sleep Apnea

**Definition/Overview**
- Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is characterized by repeated episodes of complete (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) collapse of the upper airway during sleep, leading to oxygen desaturation or sleep arousal.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Loud, disruptive snoring
- Witnessed apneas
- Excessive daytime sleepiness
- Morning headaches
- Nocturnal reflux
- Insomnia
- Nocturia

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Polysomnography (PSG) or home sleep apnea testing
- Apnea: cessation of airflow >90% of baseline for ≥10 seconds
- Hypopnea: airflow reduction ≥30% for >10 seconds with ≥3% oxygen desaturation or arousal
- Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI): Mild (5-15 events/hour), Moderate (15-30 events/hour), Severe (>30 events/hour)

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Asthma
- Central sleep apnea
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
- Depression
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
- Hypothyroidism
- Narcolepsy
- Periodic limb movement disorder

**Treatment Options**
- Lifestyle changes: weight loss, avoid alcohol/sedatives
- Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)
- Oral appliances (mandibular advancement devices)
- Surgical interventions: Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), Maxillomandibular advancement (MMA), Hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HNS)
- Positional therapy for supine-related OSA

**Critical Considerations**
- CPAP adherence is crucial for treatment effectiveness
- Surgical options depend on anatomical factors and patient-specific characteristics
- Hypoglossal nerve stimulation requires specific eligibility criteria

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Prevalence: ~1 billion globally, higher in males, obesity, and certain ethnicities
- Pathophysiology: Pharyngeal narrowing/closure due to anatomical and neuromuscular factors, obesity, and other risk factors
- Rare presentations: OSA in non-obese individuals, atypical anatomical contributors

**Central Sleep Apnea (CSA) Overview**
- CSA involves cessation of ventilatory effort due to dysfunction in the brain's respiratory control centers.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Abrupt awakenings with shortness of breath
- Insomnia
- Excessive daytime sleepiness
- Difficulty concentrating
- Mood changes

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- PSG with ≥5 central apneas/hypopneas per hour of sleep
- Absence of ventilatory effort during apneas

**Treatment Options**
- Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) therapies: CPAP, BPAP, ASV (not recommended for reduced EF)
- Supplemental oxygen
- Phrenic nerve stimulators
- Pharmacological agents (investigational)

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Similar to OSA, with additional considerations for neuromuscular diseases and heart failure

**Prognosis & Complications**
- Worse prognosis in heart failure with CSA
- Increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
- Systemic hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, arrhythmias, mood disorders

**Deterrence & Patient Education**
- Education on the impact of CSA on health and quality of life
- Importance of adherence to treatment and addressing underlying causes
