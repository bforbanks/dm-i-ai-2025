# Stress Test (exercise or pharmacologic)

**Definition/Overview**
- A Dipyridamole Nuclear Stress Test is a pharmacologic method for evaluating coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients unable to undergo traditional exercise stress tests. It involves the administration of dipyridamole to induce coronary vasodilation and simulate exercise conditions in the heart.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Chest pain
- Angina exacerbation
- Abnormal ECG
- Headache
- Dizziness
- Diaphoresis
- Fatigue
- Arrhythmia
- Bronchospasm
- Hypotension
- Ataxia
- Tinnitus
- Pruritis
- Nausea
- Depersonalization
- Edema
- Myalgia

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Indications for dipyridamole include thromboembolism prophylaxis post-cardiac valve replacement and thallium-nuclear stress testing.
- Dosing for thromboembolism prophylaxis: 75 to 100 mg PO 4 times daily with warfarin.
- Myocardial perfusion scan dosing: 0.142 mg/kg/min IV infusion over 4 minutes, max 70 mg.
- Pediatric dosing: 2.0 to 6.0mg/kg/daily for antiplatelet effect.

**Differential Diagnosis**
- CAD
- Stroke
- Mechanical valve thromboembolism
- Coronary artery stenosis
- Hemodialysis graft patency maintenance

**Treatment Options**
- Dipyridamole tablet forms: 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg.
- Injectable solution: 5 mg/mL for pharmacologic stress testing.
- Aminophylline for reversal of complications: 50 to 250 mg IV push over 30 to 60 seconds post-radiotracer injection.

**Critical Considerations**
- Contraindications include hypersensitivity to dipyridamole and thrombocytopenia.
- Caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hepatic impairment, and concurrent antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy.
- Aminophylline should be available for urgent/emergent reversal of adverse effects during pharmacologic stress testing.

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- CAD is the leading cause of death globally.
- Dipyridamole acts by inhibiting phosphodiesterase and adenosine deaminase, increasing cAMP and cGMP, which inhibits platelet aggregation and promotes vasodilation.
- Pharmacologic stress testing is indicated when exercise stress testing cannot be performed.
