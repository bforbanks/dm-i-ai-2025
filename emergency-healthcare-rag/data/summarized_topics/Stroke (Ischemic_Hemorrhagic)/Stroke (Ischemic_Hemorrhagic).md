# Stroke (Ischemic_Hemorrhagic)

**Definition/Overview**
- Ischemic stroke: Obstruction of blood vessels leading to reduced blood supply to the brain.
- Hemorrhagic stroke: Rupture of blood vessels causing intracranial bleeding.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Sudden onset of neurological deficits
- Altered consciousness
- Headache
- Vomiting
- Seizures

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Ischemic: Clinical presentation, CT/MRI showing infarction, vascular imaging for occlusion
- Hemorrhagic: Clinical presentation, CT/MRI showing intracranial bleed, angiography for aneurysm/AVM

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Ischemic: TIA, migraine, seizure
- Hemorrhagic: Tumor, arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm

**Treatment Options**
- Ischemic: IV thrombolysis (alteplase), mechanical thrombectomy, antiplatelet therapy
- Hemorrhagic: BP control, surgical evacuation, reversal of anticoagulation

**Critical Considerations**
- Ischemic: Time-sensitive interventions, reperfusion injury
- Hemorrhagic: Management of ICP, secondary injury prevention

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Ischemic: Most common stroke type, atherosclerosis, cardioembolism
- Hemorrhagic: Less common, higher mortality, hypertension, aneurysms

**Length Strategy**
- Preserve essential details, prioritize clinical relevance, maintain logical flow and structural clarity.
