# Syncope

**Definition/Overview**
- Syncope is a sudden, transient loss of consciousness and postural tone, with cardiac syncope indicating a potentially fatal underlying cardiac condition.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Sudden loss of consciousness
- Loss of postural tone
- Possible prodromal palpitations or chest pain
- Absence of prodromal vagal symptoms

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- ECG findings: bradycardia, tachycardia, conduction blocks, prolonged PR or QT intervals, delta waves (WPW), epsilon waves (ARVC)
- Echocardiogram: structural abnormalities
- Implantable cardiac monitor or Holter monitor: arrhythmias
- Electrophysiologic study: inducible arrhythmias
- Natriuretic peptide levels: cardiac syncope and risk of adverse cardiac events

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Reflex syncope (vasovagal, situational)
- Orthostatic hypotension (autonomic dysfunction, drug-induced, volume depletion)
- Neurologic causes (seizures, TIA)
- Metabolic disturbances (hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances)
- Psychogenic pseudosyncope

**Treatment Options**
- Pacemaker implantation for bradyarrhythmias
- Catheter ablation for tachyarrhythmias
- Medication adjustments for drug-induced QT prolongation
- Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for structural cardiac diseases and inherited channelopathies
- Surgical interventions for structural abnormalities (e.g., valve replacement, tumor resection)

**Critical Considerations**
- ECG progression: monitoring for changes in rhythm or conduction
- Complications: risk of recurrent syncope, physical injuries from falls
- Contraindications: driving restrictions until syncope is controlled

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Affects 30-40% of the population, with cardiac causes in 15% of cases
- Higher prevalence in the elderly and males
- Pathophysiology involves inadequate cerebral perfusion due to reduced cardiac output from mechanical obstruction or arrhythmias
- Rare variants include inherited channelopathies and structural cardiomyopathies with specific histopathologic findings
