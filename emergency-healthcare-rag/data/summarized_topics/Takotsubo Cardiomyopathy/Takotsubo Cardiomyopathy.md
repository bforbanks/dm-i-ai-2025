# Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy

**Definition/Overview**
Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is a reversible myocardial injury characterized by distinctive regional wall abnormalities of the left ventricle, often triggered by emotional or physical stressors, with mid-ventricular Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy being a specific variant.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Chest pain
- ECG changes suggestive of ischemia
- Elevation of cardiac enzymes

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- ST-segment elevation, commonly in anterior precordial leads (44% of cases)
- Other ECG findings: ST-segment depression, QT interval prolongation, T wave inversion, abnormal Q waves
- Elevated cardiac enzymes, with troponin levels ~8 times the upper limit of normal
- Absence of coronary obstruction on angiography
- Left ventricular wall motion abnormalities consistent with mid-ventricular ballooning and apical/basal hyperdynamic segments on echocardiography

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)
- Myocarditis
- Acute brain injury
- Pheochromocytoma

**Treatment Options**
- Supportive therapy focused on stressor elimination
- Heart failure and shock management guidelines for acute decompensated congestive heart failure or cardiogenic shock
- Transthoracic echocardiogram for suspected LVOT obstruction
- Anticoagulation with warfarin for LV thrombus, typically for three months

**Critical Considerations**
- LVOT obstruction avoidance of volume depletion and vasodilator therapy
- Monitoring for intraventricular thrombus formation
- Potential concurrent obstructive coronary artery disease not matching LV wall motion dysfunction

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Accounts for ~2% of STEMI population, 90% in post-menopausal women
- Mid-ventricular variant represents 14.6% of Takotsubo cases
- Proposed mechanisms: coronary artery spasm, microvascular dysfunction, catecholamine surge
- Recurrence rate of ~3.5%
- Mortality rate in hospitals of 1.1%
