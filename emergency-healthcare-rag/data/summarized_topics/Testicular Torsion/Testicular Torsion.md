# Testicular Torsion

**Definition/Overview**
Testicular torsion is a urologic emergency characterized by the twisting of the spermatic cord, leading to compromised blood flow and potential testicular necrosis if not promptly treated.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Sudden onset of unilateral scrotal pain
- Swelling and erythema of the scrotum
- Absent cremasteric reflex
- High-riding or abnormally positioned testicle
- Associated nausea or vomiting
- Lower abdominal or inguinal pain

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- TWIST scoring system:
  - Hard testis (2 points)
  - Swelling (2 points)
  - Nausea/vomiting (1 point)
  - Absent cremasteric reflex (1 point)
  - High riding testis (1 point)
- Ultrasound findings:
  - Reduced or absent color Doppler flow
  - Hydrocele presence
  - Testicular size and echotexture changes
- Urine analysis for pyuria (to rule out epididymitis or orchitis)

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Testis tumor
- Epididymitis
- Hydrocele
- Traumatic hematoma
- Orchitis
- Torsion of testicular appendages

**Treatment Options**
- Immediate urologic surgery consultation
- Manual detorsion if surgery is not immediately available
- Orchiopexy for salvageable testis
- Orchiectomy with possible testicular prosthesis insertion for non-viable testis

**Critical Considerations**
- Time-sensitive condition with testicular viability significantly decreasing after 6 hours
- Surgery within 8 hours of symptom onset increases salvage rates
- Neonatal torsion may require bilateral scrotal exploration and contralateral orchiopexy

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Most common in adolescents but can occur at any age
- Bell clapper deformity as a common cause
- Extravaginal torsion in neonates
- Venous congestion followed by arterial occlusion leads to ischemia and potential necrosis
- Complete torsion can lead to rapid loss of testicular viability
