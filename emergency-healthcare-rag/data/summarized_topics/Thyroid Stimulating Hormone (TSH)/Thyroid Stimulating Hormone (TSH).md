# Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)

**Definition/Overview**
- Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) is a pituitary hormone that regulates the production of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) by the thyroid gland, playing a critical role in metabolism, growth, and development.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Hyperthyroidism: Weight loss, tachycardia, tremors, anxiety, heat intolerance
- Hypothyroidism: Weight gain, bradycardia, fatigue, cold intolerance, constipation

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Normal TSH levels: 0.4 to 4.5 milliunits/ml
- Primary hypothyroidism: Elevated TSH, low free T4
- Secondary hypothyroidism: Low TSH, low free T4
- Primary hyperthyroidism: Decreased TSH, elevated free T4/T3
- Secondary hyperthyroidism: Elevated TSH, elevated free T4/T3

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Hyperthyroidism: Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, toxic adenoma
- Hypothyroidism: Hashimoto thyroiditis, thyroidectomy, iodine deficiency, congenital hypothyroidism

**Treatment Options**
- Hyperthyroidism: Propylthiouracil, thyroidectomy, radioiodine therapy, beta-adrenergic blocking agents
- Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone replacement therapy

**Critical Considerations**
- TSH is highly sensitive to changes in free T4 and T3 levels due to negative feedback.
- TSH levels are an early indicator of thyroid dysfunction.
- Consider the Jod-Basedow Effect and Wolff-Chaikoff effect in iodine-induced thyroid dysfunction.

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- TSH secretion is regulated by TRH from the hypothalamus and inhibited by thyroid hormones through negative feedback.
- Congenital hypothyroidism can result from mutations in genes like NIS, TPO, DUOX2, and DEHAL1.
- MCT8 deficiency leads to severe cognitive and motor impairment.
- BRAF V600E mutation is associated with papillary thyroid cancer.
