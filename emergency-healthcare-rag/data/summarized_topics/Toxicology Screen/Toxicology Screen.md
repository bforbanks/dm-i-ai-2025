# Toxicology Screen

**Definition/Overview**
Toxicology screening involves diagnostic testing to identify drug exposures in acutely ill patients presenting to the emergency department, which may be due to unintentional poisoning, self-harm, or environmental exposures.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Altered mental status
- Unexplained symptoms in undifferentiated patients
- Signs of specific intoxication based on substance

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- **Urine Testing**: Qualitative detection of cocaine, amphetamines, marijuana, PCP, opioids, and sometimes benzodiazepines; not quantitative
- **Serum Testing**: Quantitative detection of acetaminophen, aspirin, salicylates, ethanol, and sometimes tricyclic antidepressants or barbiturates

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Non-toxicological causes of altered mental status
- Metabolic, neurological, or psychiatric conditions mimicking intoxication

**Treatment Options**
- Supportive care based on clinical presentation
- Specific antidotes where applicable (e.g., N-acetyl-cysteine for acetaminophen toxicity)

**Critical Considerations**
- Interpretation of drug screens requires correlation with clinical presentation
- False positives/negatives are possible; knowledge of cross-reactivity and detection windows is essential
- Serial testing may be necessary for certain substances to determine concentration trends

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Alcohol intoxication is the most common substance-related visit
- Rising rates of opioid, cocaine, marijuana, and synthetic drug-related visits
- Drug screens may not detect newer substances like synthetic cannabinoids, MDMA, or novel opioids and PCP variants

**Structural Clarity**
- **Urine Testing**: Detects presence but not concentration; detection windows vary by substance
- **Serum Testing**: Provides concentration, aiding in management of intentional overdoses (e.g., acetaminophen, salicylates)
- **Clinical Relevance**: Screens must be interpreted in the clinical context; positive results may not always indicate acute intoxication, and negative results do not rule out substance use
