# Traumatic Brain Injury

**Definition/Overview**
Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is an injury to the brain caused by an external mechanical force, which can be classified as closed or penetrating. Closed head injury (CHI) is the most common form of TBI and includes concussion, contusion, diffuse axonal injury, and intracranial hematoma.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Loss of consciousness
- Post-traumatic amnesia
- Headache
- Vomiting
- Seizures
- Neurological deficits
- Signs of basilar skull fracture (e.g., Battle sign, raccoon eyes)
- Cushing triad in increased intracranial pressure (hypertension, bradycardia, irregular respirations)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score: mild (14-15), moderate (9-12), severe (3-8)
- CT scan for moderate to severe TBI or mild TBI with risk factors
- MRI for diffuse axonal injury (DAI)
- New Orleans Criteria and Canadian CT Head Injury/Trauma Rule for adults
- Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) head trauma algorithm for children

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Primary Brain Injuries: Concussion, Contusion, DAI, Epidural Hematoma, Subdural Hematoma, Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage, Traumatic Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
- Secondary Brain Injuries: Cerebral Edema, Ischemia/Stroke, Infection, Hypoxic-Anoxic Injury
- Other: Skull Fractures, Cervical Spine Injuries, Post-Concussion Syndrome, Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), Second Impact Syndrome, Psychiatric Conditions

**Treatment Options**
- Airway, breathing, and circulation management
- Maintaining cerebral perfusion pressure
- Preventing hypoxia, hypotension, hypercapnia, or hypocapnia
- ICP monitoring and management
- Neurosurgical interventions for traumatic intracranial lesions
- Rehabilitation and return-to-play progression for mild TBI

**Critical Considerations**
- Monitoring for signs of increased intracranial pressure and herniation
- Management of refractory intracranial hypertension with tiered interventions
- Importance of early and continuous rehabilitation

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Approximately 1.7 million individuals affected annually in the U.S.
- Higher prevalence in older adolescents and adults over 65
- Primary injury from direct impact, rapid acceleration-deceleration, or penetration
- Secondary injury from hypoxia, hypotension, and raised intracranial pressure
- Pathways include glutamate hyper-excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation

**Prognosis**
- Influenced by age, GCS score, anisocoria, herniation symptoms, polytrauma, hypoxia, hypotension, and type of lesion
- Marshall and Rotterdam CT scores for risk stratification
- Long-term risks include postconcussive symptoms, CTE, and neurologic damage

**Complications**
- Brain death, CNS infection, CSF leaks, dementia, deep vein thrombosis, depression, PTSD, dyselectrolytemia, endocrinopathies, hydrocephalus, malignant cerebral edema, neurogenic pulmonary edema, neurovascular injuries, seizures, spasticity, stunned myocardium syndrome, substance use disorder, vasospasm

**Deterrence and Patient Education**
- Prevention through safety measures in vehicles, sports, and daily activities
- Importance of not returning to activities until full recovery from an initial TBI to prevent recurrent injuries and cumulative effects
- Suicide prevention and seeking help for neurologic and psychiatric complications after TBI
