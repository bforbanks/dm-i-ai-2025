# Troponin I_T

**Definition/Overview**
- Troponin I_T is a cardiac-specific biomarker used to diagnose myocardial injury, including myocardial infarction (MI), and has become an essential component of cardiac workups since its clinical introduction in 1995.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Chest pain
- Symptoms of acute myocardial ischemia
- New ischemic ECG changes
- Development of pathological Q waves
- Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or regional wall motion abnormality

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Elevated troponin I_T levels above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL)
- Acute myocardial injury indicated by a rise and/or fall in troponin values
- ECG findings for STEMI: ST-segment elevations >1 mm in contiguous leads with reciprocal changes, new left bundle branch block, or posterior ECG changes
- ECG findings for NSTEMI: Elevated troponin without ST-segment elevation

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Myocarditis
- Pericarditis
- Cardiac contusion or trauma
- Aortic dissection
- Pulmonary embolism
- Stroke
- Renal failure
- Infiltrative diseases (e.g., amyloidosis)

**Treatment Options**
- For STEMI: Emergent coronary catheterization or thrombolytic therapy
- For NSTEMI: Medical management including dual antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation (e.g., heparin)
- Serial troponin testing spaced 3 to 6 hours apart for suspected ischemic events with initially normal troponin

**Critical Considerations**
- Troponin levels typically rise within 2-3 hours post-chest pain onset, peak at 12-48 hours, and normalize over 4-10 days
- False-positive results due to skeletal muscle isoforms, renal disease, or heterophile antibodies
- False-negative results due to poor preanalytical handling or interference factors

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Troponin I_T is specific to cardiac muscle with no expression in healthy skeletal muscle
- Myocardial infarction results from coronary blood flow obstruction, leading to myocyte necrosis and troponin release
- Chronic kidney disease can cause elevated troponin levels without cardiac disease
- Rare presentations include troponin elevation in non-cardiac conditions such as stroke or severe systemic illness

**Quality Control and Lab Safety**
- Two levels of control materials analyzed at least once every 24 hours
- Participation in external quality control or proficiency testing programs
- Use of Westgard multi-rules for quality control evaluation
- Standard precautions for handling potentially infectious materials
