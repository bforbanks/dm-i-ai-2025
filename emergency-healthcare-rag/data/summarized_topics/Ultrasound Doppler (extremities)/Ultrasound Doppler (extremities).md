# Ultrasound Doppler (extremities)

**Definition/Overview**
- Ultrasound Doppler for extremities is a non-invasive diagnostic tool used to evaluate blood flow in the peripheral arteries and veins, aiding in the diagnosis of conditions such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- DVT: Pain, swelling, redness, tenderness, fever, prominent superficial veins, Homanâ€™s sign, peripheral cyanosis
- PAD: Claudication, ischemic rest pain, nonhealing wounds, leg fatigue, changes in skin color or temperature

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- DVT: Positive findings on compression ultrasound, D-dimer elevation, Wells score for clinical probability
- PAD: Abnormal ankle-brachial index (ABI), abnormal pulse volume recording (PVR), abnormal continuous-wave Doppler waveforms, photoplethysmography (PPG) findings

**Differential Diagnosis**
- DVT: Cellulitis, post-thrombotic syndrome, ruptured Baker cyst, superficial thrombophlebitis, lymphedema
- PAD: Neurologic conditions (nerve root compression, peripheral neuropathy), orthopedic conditions (arthritis, stress fracture, tendinitis), venous conditions (venous claudication, venous compartment syndrome)

**Treatment Options**
- DVT: Anticoagulation (LMWH, factor Xa inhibitors, VKA), thrombolysis, compression stockings, IVC filters
- PAD: Risk factor modification, antiplatelet therapy, revascularization procedures, exercise therapy, pharmacotherapy for claudication

**Critical Considerations**
- DVT: Risk of pulmonary embolism, post-thrombotic syndrome, need for repeat ultrasound or D-dimer in certain cases
- PAD: Risk of critical limb ischemia, need for serial assessments, impact of diabetes and medial calcification on test results

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- DVT: Incidence of 1.6 per 1000 annually, Virchow's triad (vessel wall damage, stasis, hypercoagulability), associated with risk factors like immobility, surgery, cancer, genetic predispositions
- PAD: Increasing prevalence due to aging population and risk factors like diabetes, hypertension, obesity; pathophysiology involves atherosclerosis and arterial stenosis/occlusion

**Normal and Critical Findings**
- DVT: Absence of vein compressibility on ultrasound, elevated D-dimer
- PAD: ABI < 0.9, monophasic Doppler waveforms, delayed or absent PVR response after occlusion

**Interfering Factors**
- DVT: False negatives in isolated distal DVT, false positives in recent surgery or trauma
- PAD: Medial arterial calcification, exercise prior to testing, non-compressible vessels

**Complications**
- DVT: Pulmonary embolism, post-thrombotic syndrome, bleeding from anticoagulation
- PAD: Critical limb ischemia, amputation, cardiovascular events

**Patient Safety and Education**
- Patients should be informed about the non-invasive nature of the tests, the importance of following pre-test instructions, and the potential need for further testing or treatment based on results.
