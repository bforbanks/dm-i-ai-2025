# Ultrasound FAST exam

**Definition/Overview**
Ultrasound Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) is a rapid bedside ultrasound examination used to detect free fluid (blood) in the abdominal cavity, pericardial sac, or pleural spaces indicative of internal bleeding in trauma patients.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Hypotension
- Abdominal distension
- Signs of peritoneal irritation
- Decreased breath sounds (suggestive of hemothorax)
- Beck's triad (hypotension, muffled heart sounds, jugular venous distension) suggesting cardiac tamponade

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Detection of free fluid in Morison's pouch (hepatorenal space)
- Free fluid in the splenorenal recess
- Free fluid in the pelvis (rectovesical or rectouterine space)
- Pericardial effusion in the pericardial sac
- Pleural effusion in the pleural spaces

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Ascites
- Cystic masses
- Peritoneal dialysis
- Pleural effusion from non-traumatic causes
- Pericardial effusion from non-traumatic causes

**Treatment Options**
- Immediate surgical intervention (laparotomy or thoracotomy) if hemodynamically unstable with positive FAST findings
- Further imaging (CT scan) if hemodynamically stable with positive FAST findings
- Observation and serial examinations if FAST is negative but suspicion for injury remains high

**Critical Considerations**
- FAST exam does not rule out all intra-abdominal injuries; a negative FAST in a hemodynamically unstable patient may still necessitate surgical exploration.
- Serial FAST exams may be required as some hematomas or effusions can evolve over time.
- Operator skill and experience can significantly affect the sensitivity and specificity of the FAST exam.

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- FAST exams are widely used in trauma centers as part of the initial assessment of trauma patients.
- The sensitivity and specificity of FAST vary, but it is generally accepted as a rapid and non-invasive method to assess for internal bleeding.
- Pathophysiology involves the accumulation of blood or fluid in potential spaces due to injury to vessels or organs, which can be quickly identified by ultrasound.
