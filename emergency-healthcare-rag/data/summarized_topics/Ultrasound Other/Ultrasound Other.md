# Ultrasound Other

**Definition/Overview**
- Cardiac ultrasound, or echocardiography, is a noninvasive diagnostic modality providing detailed hemodynamic information at the bedside, useful for diagnosing a range of cardiac conditions.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Chest pain
- Shortness of breath
- Hypotension
- Trauma to the chest
- Cardiac arrest

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Left ventricle wall motion abnormalities suggest acute coronary syndrome.
- Right ventricle dilation and McConnell sign indicate pulmonary embolism.
- Intimal flap or aortic outflow tract dilation >4 cm suggests aortic dissection.
- Pericardial effusion, depressed left ventricle ejection fraction <50%, and E-point septal separation >7 mm support congestive heart failure or myocarditis.
- Organized cardiac activity on ultrasound post-PEA arrest is associated with survival.

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Acute coronary syndrome
- Pulmonary embolism
- Endocarditis
- Valvular heart disease
- Cardiogenic shock
- Pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology
- Aortic dissection
- Sepsis or hemorrhagic shock (hyperdynamic squeeze)

**Treatment Options**
- Thrombolytics for pulmonary embolism with right ventricle strain.
- Pericardiocentesis for pericardial effusion with tamponade.
- Supportive care for congestive heart failure.
- Surgical intervention for aortic dissection.

**Critical Considerations**
- Avoid parasternal cardiac ultrasound during CPR; other views may be used if feasible.
- Right ventricle size and function are critical in diagnosing pulmonary embolism.
- Pericardial effusion size and hemodynamic impact must be assessed for tamponade.

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Cardiac ultrasound is essential in diagnosing life-threatening conditions like tamponade, acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, and aortic dissection.
- The RUSH protocol is used for rapid evaluation of undifferentiated hypotension.
- Thoracic ultrasound is used for diagnosing pneumothorax, hemothorax, rib fractures, pulmonary contusions, pleural effusions, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, COPD, pulmonary embolism, and ARDS.

**Definition/Overview**
- Thoracic and lung ultrasound is a noninvasive diagnostic tool used to evaluate various thoracic conditions, particularly useful in emergency and trauma settings.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Chest pain
- Dyspnea
- Fever
- Hypoxia

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Pneumothorax: Absence of lung sliding, presence of "lung point" sign.
- Pleural effusion: Anechoic space between parietal and visceral pleura, "plankton sign."
- Pulmonary edema: Presence of B lines or "lung rockets."
- Pneumonia: Lung consolidation with "hepatization," presence of static or dynamic air bronchograms.
- Rib fractures: Discontinuity along the anterior rib cortex.

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Pneumothorax vs. pleural adhesions or pleurodesis
- Pleural effusion vs. abdominal ascites
- Pulmonary edema vs. other causes of B lines (e.g., pulmonary contusion)
- Pneumonia vs. atelectasis

**Treatment Options**
- Needle decompression or chest tube for pneumothorax.
- Thoracentesis for pleural effusion.
- Appropriate antimicrobial therapy for pneumonia.
- Supportive care for pulmonary edema.

**Critical Considerations**
- Ensure accurate identification of thoracic landmarks to avoid iatrogenic injury during procedures.
- Differentiate between pleural effusion and other fluid collections.
- Assess for the presence and extent of lung sliding and B lines for accurate diagnosis.

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Thoracic ultrasound is increasingly used due to its rapid availability, lack of radiation exposure, and improved sensitivity and specificity over conventional radiography for certain conditions.
