# Unstable Angina

**Definition/Overview**
Unstable angina is a manifestation of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) characterized by chest pain or discomfort that occurs at rest or with minimal exertion, signaling an increased risk of myocardial infarction or cardiac death.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Chest pain or discomfort (pressure, tightness, heaviness)
- Radiation of pain to jaw or left arm
- Shortness of breath
- Diaphoresis (sweating)
- Nausea
- Pain not fully relieved by rest or nitroglycerin

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- **ECG Findings**: T-wave flattening or inversions, ST-segment depressions; may be normal in some cases
- **Lab Tests**: Serial troponin levels, CBC, BMP
- **Imaging**: Chest X-ray
- **Stress Testing**: Exercise or pharmacologic stress testing with or without nuclear perfusion imaging
- **Cardiac Catheterization**: Diagnostic heart catheterization for anatomic assessment

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Gastrointestinal: GERD, hiatal hernia, peptic ulcer disease
- Pulmonary: Pneumothorax, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism
- Musculoskeletal: Costochondritis, rib injury, muscle spasm
- Psychiatric: Panic attack, generalized anxiety
- Cardiac non-ischemic: Pericarditis, myocarditis
- Vascular: Aortic dissection

**Treatment Options**
- **Nitrates**: For chest pain relief; contraindicated with recent phosphodiesterase inhibitors use
- **Morphine**: For pain relief when nitrates are insufficient
- **Beta-blockers**: Reduce mortality by decreasing heart rate, contractility, and blood pressure
- **Antiplatelet agents**: Dual therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel
- **Anticoagulants**: Intravenous use in acute treatment to reduce re-infarction rates
- **Revascularization**: Consideration for high-risk patients after risk stratification

**Critical Considerations**
- **ECG Progression**: Monitoring for changes indicative of worsening ischemia or infarction
- **Complications**: Risk of myocardial infarction, need for urgent revascularization
- **Contraindications**: Certain medications contraindicated in specific patient populations (e.g., calcium channel blockers in left ventricular dysfunction)

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Prevalence: 9 million in the US; increases with age
- Pathophysiology: Myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch due to atherosclerosis or vasospasm
- Rare Variants: Variant angina (Prinzmetal angina) occurs at rest without atherosclerosis
