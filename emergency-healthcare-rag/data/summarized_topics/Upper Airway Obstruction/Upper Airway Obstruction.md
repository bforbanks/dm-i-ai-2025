# Upper Airway Obstruction

**Definition/Overview**
Upper airway obstruction is an anatomic narrowing or occlusion that impedes air movement, potentially leading to acute or chronic respiratory compromise.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Acute distress
- Altered mentation
- Inability to move air effectively
- Stridor, wheezing, or snoring
- Cyanosis
- Use of accessory muscles for breathing
- Changes in voice or cry
- Drooling or difficulty swallowing

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- History of events leading to obstruction
- Physical exam focused on nasal passages, oropharynx, and neck
- Nasal speculum examination, rigid/flexible endoscopy, direct laryngoscopy
- Imaging: lateral head and neck x-rays, CT scans, MRI (with caution in acute distress)
- Evaluation of airway diameter and soft tissue structures

**Differential Diagnosis**
Acute:
- Aspiration
- Infection
- Hemorrhage
- Angioedema
- Iatrogenic causes
- Blunt trauma
- Inhalation injury
- Neuromuscular disease

Chronic:
- Infection
- Post-intubation stenosis
- Amyloidosis
- Sarcoidosis
- Tumor
- Collagen vascular disease
- Mediastinal mass
- Esophageal tumor
- Cardiovascular anomaly
- Neuromuscular disease
- Idiopathic
- Tonsillar enlargement in children

**Treatment Options**
- Immediate airway clearance (chin lift, jaw thrust)
- Oxygen supplementation
- Nasotracheal or endotracheal intubation
- Tracheostomy or cricothyroidotomy
- Foreign body removal
- Antibiotics and surgical drainage for infections
- Surgical consultation for obstructing masses
- Management of chronic conditions (e.g., CPAP for obstructive sleep apnea)

**Critical Considerations**
- Rapid intervention in acute obstruction to prevent hypoxic brain damage or death
- Cervical spine precautions in trauma cases
- Availability of airway management experts and equipment
- Consideration of underlying etiology for targeted treatment

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Common in children <4 years and adults with inflammation, infection, trauma
- Pathologies include deviated septum, foreign bodies, macroglossia, tracheal anomalies, abscesses, tumors, anaphylaxis, burns
- Chronic obstruction can lead to cardiopulmonary compromise and morbidity
