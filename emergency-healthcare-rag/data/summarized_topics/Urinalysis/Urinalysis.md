# Urinalysis

**Definition/Overview**
- A 24-hour urinalysis is a comprehensive urine test for diagnosing and managing conditions like urinary stone disease, proteinuria, multiple myeloma, pheochromocytoma, and assessing renal function.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Symptoms vary based on the underlying condition being evaluated, such as renal colic for stones or hypertension for pheochromocytoma.

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Accurate 24-hour urine collection is critical, with specific laboratory tests for conditions such as:
  - Urinary stone disease: volume, pH, calcium, citrate, oxalate, etc.
  - Proteinuria: total protein, albumin-to-creatinine ratio.
  - Pheochromocytoma: fractionated metanephrines and catecholamines.
  - Renal function: creatinine and urea clearance.

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Differential diagnoses depend on the specific analytes measured and their levels, considering various renal and systemic disorders.

**Treatment Options**
- Treatment is condition-specific, such as dietary modifications, medications like thiazides for hypercalciuria, or potassium citrate for hypocitraturia.

**Critical Considerations**
- Proper collection and preservation of the urine sample are essential.
- Medications and dietary factors can interfere with test results.
- Creatinine clearance overestimates GFR by 10-20%.

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Nephrolithiasis affects 10-11% globally, with rising incidence due to diet and lifestyle factors.
- CKD prevalence is increasing due to diabetes, hypertension, and aging.
- Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare, with specific biochemical pathways for catecholamine metabolism.
- Pathophysiology varies with the condition being assessed, such as stone formation dynamics or proteinuria mechanisms.
