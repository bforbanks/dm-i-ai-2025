# Urine Pregnancy Test

**Definition/Overview**
Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced by trophoblast tissue in early embryos, essential for pregnancy maintenance and used diagnostically in pregnancy and certain cancers.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Not applicable for this topic as hCG is a laboratory marker, not a clinical symptom or sign.

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- **Serum hCG**: Quantitative measurement using immunometric assays; sensitivity as low as 1-2 mIU/mL.
- **Urine hCG**: Qualitative tests with sensitivity starting at 20-50 mIU/mL; some detect levels as low as 6.3-12.5 mIU/mL.
- **Capillary Testing**: Emerging method with potential for home-based testing.

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Normal pregnancy
- Abnormal pregnancies (e.g., ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy)
- Gestational trophoblastic disease
- Germ cell tumors
- Non-gestational cancers (e.g., testicular, ovarian, bladder)

**Treatment Options**
- Not applicable for this topic as hCG is a diagnostic marker, not a treatable condition.

**Critical Considerations**
- False-positive results: due to heterophile antibodies, rheumatoid factors, IgA deficiency, renal failure, recent blood transfusion, exogenous hCG.
- False-negative results: early conception, dilute urine, the hook effect at very high hCG levels.
- Variability in assay results necessitates consistent testing methods for accurate monitoring.

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- hCG supports the corpus luteum and progesterone production.
- Pathologically elevated in gestational trophoblastic disease and certain cancers.
- Serum levels rise exponentially in the first trimester, peak at 10 weeks, and stabilize after 16 weeks.
- Post-pregnancy hCG return to zero takes 7-60 days.
- Elevated second-trimester beta-hCG levels may indicate adverse pregnancy outcomes.
- In nonpregnant patients, elevated hCG may indicate malignancy, with higher levels associated with poorer prognosis in testicular cancer.
