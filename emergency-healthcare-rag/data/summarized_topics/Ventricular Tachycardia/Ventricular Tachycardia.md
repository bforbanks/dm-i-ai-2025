# Ventricular Tachycardia

**Definition/Overview**
- Pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia characterized by rapid, ineffective ventricular contractions leading to absent pulse and organ perfusion failure.

**Key Symptoms & Signs**
- Chest pain
- Palpitations
- Dyspnea
- Light-headedness
- Syncope
- Hypotension
- Tachypnea
- Elevated jugular venous pressure
- Altered S1 heart sound
- Sudden collapse

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Tachycardia (>100 bpm)
- Wide QRS complexes (>120 milliseconds)
- Atrioventricular (AV) dissociation
- Fusion or capture beats
- Electrical axis between -90 to -180 degrees
- Classical Criteria (AV dissociation, capture/fusion beats, concordance, bundle branch configurations)
- Brugada Criteria (absence of RS complex in precordial leads, R to S interval >100 ms, AV dissociation)
- Vereckei Criteria (AV dissociation, specific findings in lead aVR)

**Differential Diagnosis**
- Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrant conduction
- SVT with pre-excitation
- Antidromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT)

**Treatment Options**
- Immediate electrical cardioversion (150-200 J biphasic, 360 J monophasic)
- CPR (30 compressions followed by 2 breaths, 5 cycles after each shock)
- Intravenous vasopressors (epinephrine 1 mg IV every 3-5 minutes or vasopressin 40 units IV once)
- Antiarrhythmic drugs (amiodarone, sotalol)
- Post-resuscitation care (hypothermia cooling to 32-34 degrees Celsius for 24 hours)
- Urgent coronary angiography and PCI if myocardial infarction is suspected
- ICD implantation for primary and secondary prevention of SCD

**Critical Considerations**
- Immediate defibrillation is critical; delays reduce survival rates.
- Monitor for metabolic acidosis post-cardioversion.
- Consider hypothermia protocol for neurologic recovery in unresponsive patients post-resuscitation.

**Epidemiology & Pathophysiology**
- Approximately 300,000 deaths per year in the U.S.
- Increased automaticity and triggered activity in ventricular myocardium
- Monomorphic VT typically due to myocardial scarring from infarction
- Polymorphic VT often related to genetic mutations affecting ion channels
- Causes include structural heart disease, electrolyte disturbances, drugs, channelopathies, and other factors like hypovolemia and hypoxia.
