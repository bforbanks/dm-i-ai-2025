In addition, it can be used to diagnose diabetes mellitus.[1] Hemoglobin is a protein found exclusively in red blood cells, giving blood its bright red color. The primary role of hemoglobin is to carry oxygen from the lungs to all the cells in the body. Hemoglobin becomes glycated or coated with glucose from the bloodstream. As blood glucose levels increase, more glucose attaches to the hemoglobin protein, resulting in a higher A1c value.[2] Since red blood cells have an average lifespan of about 3 months,"

Unstable angina resembles an NSTEMI, but normal cardiac markers distinguish it.[1][2][3] Myocardial infarction (MI) causes permanent damage to the heart muscle due to inadequate oxygen supply. MI can impair diastolic and systolic function, increasing the risk of arrhythmias. Additionally, an MI can lead to various serious complications.
