# Enhanced NNUNet for Tumor Segmentation

This enhanced version of the NNUNet model incorporates several advanced features specifically designed to improve detection of smaller tumor nuances and fine details in medical images.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Attention Mechanisms (CBAM)
- **Channel Attention**: Focuses on important feature channels that contain tumor-relevant information
- **Spatial Attention**: Concentrates on spatial regions where tumors are likely to be present
- **Combined Effect**: Helps the model pay attention to subtle tumor features that might be missed by standard convolutions

### 2. Residual Connections
- **Improved Gradient Flow**: Helps with training deeper networks by providing direct paths for gradients
- **Feature Preservation**: Maintains important low-level features throughout the network
- **Better Convergence**: Enables training of deeper architectures without vanishing gradients

### 3. Multi-Scale Feature Fusion
- **Multiple Receptive Fields**: Uses 1x1, 3x3, and 5x5 convolutions to capture features at different scales
- **Fine Detail Preservation**: 1x1 convolutions preserve fine details
- **Context Integration**: Larger kernels capture broader context for better tumor localization
- **Scale Invariance**: Helps detect tumors of varying sizes

### 4. Deep Supervision
- **Multi-Scale Predictions**: Provides supervision at multiple decoder levels
- **Better Gradient Flow**: Improves gradient propagation through the network
- **Enhanced Training**: Helps the model learn both fine and coarse tumor features

### 5. Deeper Architecture
- **Increased Depth**: 5 levels instead of 4 for better feature extraction
- **More Channels**: 48 base channels instead of 32 for increased capacity
- **Better Feature Hierarchy**: More sophisticated feature representations

## Configuration Optimizations

### Loss Function Tuning
- **Reduced BCE Weight**: 0.3 instead of 0.4 to give more importance to Dice loss
- **Increased False Negative Penalty**: 0.02 to heavily penalize missed tumors
- **Exponential Scheduler**: Smoother penalty increase over 80 epochs
- **Patient/Control Weighting**: 2.0 for patient images, 0.3 for control images

### Training Configuration
- **Extended Training**: 200 epochs for complex model convergence
- **Frequent Analysis**: Dice analysis every 2 epochs
- **More Checkpoints**: Save top 10 models for better model selection

## Expected Improvements

### For Small Tumor Detection
1. **Attention Mechanisms**: Focus computational resources on tumor regions
2. **Multi-Scale Features**: Capture both fine details and broader context
3. **Residual Connections**: Preserve fine details through the network
4. **Deep Supervision**: Provide supervision at multiple scales

### For Overall Performance
1. **Deeper Network**: Better feature extraction capabilities
2. **Enhanced Loss Function**: Better optimization for tumor detection
3. **Improved Regularization**: Balanced dropout and attention mechanisms

## Usage

The enhanced model can be used with the same interface as the original NNUNet:

```python
from tumor_segmentation.models.NNUNetStyle.model import NNUNetStyle

model = NNUNetStyle(
    in_channels=1,
    num_classes=1,
    use_attention=True,
    use_residual=True,
    use_multiscale=True,
    use_deep_supervision=True
)
```

## Feature Ablation

You can disable individual features to test their impact:

```python
# Test without attention
model = NNUNetStyle(use_attention=False)

# Test without residual connections
model = NNUNetStyle(use_residual=False)

# Test without multi-scale fusion
model = NNUNetStyle(use_multiscale=False)

# Test without deep supervision
model = NNUNetStyle(use_deep_supervision=False)
```

## Memory Considerations

The enhanced model uses more memory due to:
- Additional attention mechanisms
- Deeper architecture
- Multi-scale feature fusion
- Deep supervision outputs

Consider reducing `base_channels` or `depth` if memory is limited.

## Expected Training Time

Due to the increased complexity, training will take approximately 2-3x longer than the original model. The benefits in tumor detection accuracy should justify the additional training time.
